  Use this skill when the user asks what new models to try or benchmark, wants newly released open models discovered,
  wants trending models mapped to suitable GPU hardware, or wants the maintained recipe set refreshed. It produces a
  ranked shortlist or lifecycle selection ready for the `onboard-model` skill, using keyless discovery data, web
  search, and a VRAM fit calculation.

# Discover Models to Explore

Turn "what models are worth our GPU hours?" into either a concrete shortlist or a refresh of Emmy's recipe
lifecycle. New open-weight models are filtered to the ones with real demand, then mapped to the GPU configurations
they fit. Existing recipes are ranked by current community and serving value so the small maintained set stays
focused, useful lower-priority recipes stay available on a best-effort basis, and only technically superseded models
become obsolete.

Everything here is **keyless and read-only**: `scripts/new_models.py` hits public OpenRouter + HuggingFace
endpoints, and the rest is web search. No servers are touched. In automated lifecycle mode the skill returns a JSON
manifest; repository-owned workflow code validates it and writes recipe tags and onboarding shells.

## Pipeline

```
scripts/new_models.py  →  per-model news/hype search  →  rank by demand  →  VRAM fit calc  →  hardware → model matrix
   (candidates +            (qualitative signal)          (pick finalists)    (params×quant)     (the deliverable)
    HF popularity + Elo)
```

## Step 0 — Choose the output mode

Use **survey mode** for an interactive shortlist or hardware matrix. Use **lifecycle mode** when the prompt requests
`maintained_models`, `best_effort_models`, `obsolete_models`, and `onboarding_models` JSON for repository automation.
The prompt owns the exact maintained-set size and target hardware; do not ask follow-up questions in lifecycle mode.

For survey mode, ask only if the user has not already implied it:

- **Time window** — default the script's ~90 days (`--since` default). Widen with `--since 2026-01-01` if they
  want "this year".
- **Modality** — default include multimodal (shown with a `modality` column); add `--text-only` if they only
  serve text.
- **Target hardware** — default the full fleet (B200, H200, H100, Pro6000, RTX5090, RTX4090). If they name a
  subset, only bucket for those.
- **How many finalists** — default ~5–8, spread across the hardware tiers.

## Step 1 — Inventory recipes and candidates

In lifecycle mode, read every `recipes/*/recipe.yaml` first. Treat the top-level tags as follows:

- `maintained` — a tested recipe selected for periodic testing and optimization;
- `best-effort` — a useful runnable recipe that is not selected for periodic testing and optimization;
- `obsolete` — retained for history but disabled because an all-around better model for the same task is available at
  a comparable or lower practical VRAM footprint;
- `onboarding` + `untested` — a recipe shell that is not eligible for the maintained set yet.

Low demand, age, and exclusion from the maintained set are not reasons to mark a recipe obsolete. An obsolete recipe
can return to the maintained or best-effort set when the evidence changes. Never classify an onboarding/untested
shell. Untagged complete recipes are eligible and must be classified on the first lifecycle run.

Run the discovery script with arena enrichment, capturing JSON for parsing and the table for a human view.
Use `--workers 4` to stay gentle on the HF metadata endpoint (it rate-limits bursts; don't re-run in a loop):

```bash
./venv/bin/python scripts/new_models.py --arena --workers 4 --json > /tmp/new_models.json
./venv/bin/python scripts/new_models.py --arena --workers 4          # readable table for the user
```

The script already does the hard part: it lists open-weight models OpenRouter hosts (catalog entries with a
`hugging_face_id`), **excludes active families already in `recipes/`**, drops anything older than `--since`, verifies
each on HuggingFace, and ranks by HF momentum. Each JSON row in `models[]` carries:

| Field | Meaning | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `hf_id` | HuggingFace repo id | the model identity; feeds `onboard-model` |
| `created_at` | HF release date | recency |
| `downloads` | HF 30-day pulls | adoption (lagging, size-biased toward small models) |
| `likes` | cumulative HF likes | reputation |
| `trending` | HF trendingScore | **momentum / "hot right now"** (best single demand signal) |
| `elo` / `arena_rank` | LMArena Elo + rank (blank if unrated) | **quality**; blank usually = too new to be rated, not bad |
| `modality` | `text->text`, `text+image->text`, … | multimodal flag |

The table footer also flags stale OpenRouter→HF mappings ("NOT ON HF") and likely arena fuzzy-match misses —
skim those; a miss can mean a model you'd otherwise drop actually has a strong Elo under a slightly different name.

Obsolete recipes are deliberately not excluded, which lets a renewed model resurface as a reactivation candidate.
Take the top ~8–12 by `trending` (tie-break `elo`, then `downloads`) into Step 2. The script's full flag list is
documented in `CLAUDE.md` (scripts section).

## Step 2 — Research news & hype per candidate (web search required)

The script gives *quantitative* demand (HF momentum, arena Elo). Layer on *qualitative* mindshare — what people
are actually saying. For each top candidate, web-search in parallel:

- `"<model name>" release` / `"<model name>" benchmark` — official announcement, benchmark claims (MMLU, GPQA,
  LiveCodeBench, SWE-bench, AIME).
- `"<model name>" vs` — head-to-head comparisons (a sign people care).
- Buzz on Reddit (r/LocalLLaMA), Hacker News, X — is it being discussed, or did it land silently?
- The releasing **lab's reputation** (DeepSeek, Qwen, MiniMax, Moonshot/Kimi, Mistral, NVIDIA, Liquid, IBM
  Granite, Allen AI/OLMo) — established labs draw adoption faster.

Distill each into a one-line **demand read**: *strong* (benchmark wins + active discussion + reputable lab),
*moderate*, or *niche/quiet*. Cross-check against the script signals — a model high on HF trend **and** loud
online is a strong pick; high downloads but silent is often a small fine-tuning base, not a flagship.

## Step 3 — Classify recipes and select onboarding models

Combine signals into a shortlist. A model is **promising** when it scores on several of:

- High HF `trending` (real, current momentum) — weighted highest for "what's hot".
- High arena `elo` / low `arena_rank` (proven quality) — when present.
- Strong Step-2 hype (mindshare, benchmark wins, reputable lab).
- **Novelty for emmy** — a new architecture / quant / size we haven't benchmarked teaches us more than yet
  another sibling of an existing recipe.

Drop: tiny fine-tuning bases riding download counts, models with no engine support yet (note it, revisit later),
and anything the user explicitly doesn't care about. Aim for a spread of **sizes** so the next step can fill
several hardware tiers (don't pick five 400B MoEs).

In lifecycle mode:

- choose exactly the requested number of existing, fully configured recipes as maintained;
- classify every other fully configured recipe as best-effort or obsolete, with every complete recipe appearing in
  exactly one of the three lifecycle lists;
- prefer best-effort whenever a recipe remains useful; use obsolete only when a named maintained or best-effort
  replacement is all-around better for the same task at a comparable or lower practical VRAM footprint;
- include that replacement and a concise technical rationale for every obsolete decision;
- choose only enough genuinely new models to keep at most three total onboarding shells on the prompt's exact target;
  existing onboarding/untested shells consume the available slots;
- use exact `model.huggingface` IDs from recipe YAML for maintained entries;
- prefer current demand and serving value, while keeping a useful mix of sizes, modalities, and architectures.

## Step 4 — Hardware requirements per finalist

For each finalist, pull from the HF model card / `config.json` (web search or the repo): **total parameters**,
**active parameters** (MoE), and the **available quantizations** (is there an FP8 / AWQ / NVFP4 / INT4 repo, or
only BF16?). Then compute VRAM to fit.

**VRAM rules of thumb** (weights only; per GPU):

```
weight VRAM ≈ total_params(B) × bytes_per_param
    bytes_per_param:  BF16/FP16 = 2  ·  FP8 = 1  ·  AWQ/INT4 ≈ 0.5
min-to-serve ≈ weight VRAM × 1.3        # + CUDA graphs, activations, a small KV cache at modest context
long-context / high-concurrency ≈ weight VRAM × 1.5+  (KV cache grows with context × concurrency)
```

Two traps:
- **MoE VRAM is governed by TOTAL params** (all experts load into memory), not active params — active params
  only drive *throughput*. A 235B-A22B MoE needs ~235B worth of weights resident.
- **Quantization decides the GPU.** The same model in BF16 vs AWQ can be a 4× VRAM difference — always check
  which quant repos actually exist before assigning a tier.

**Multi-GPU:** if it doesn't fit on one card, tensor-parallel across N (`tensor_parallel_size`): per-GPU need
≈ `min-to-serve / N` + per-GPU overhead. N must divide the model's attention head count; prefer 2/4/8.

**Fleet VRAM** (single GPU; multiply by `gpu_count` for multi-GPU nodes):

| GPU (hardware.py name) | VRAM | short |
|---|---|---|
| `NVIDIA B200` | ~180 GB | b200 |
| `NVIDIA H200 141GB` | 141 GB | h200 |
| `NVIDIA H100 80GB` | 80 GB | h100 |
| `NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell {Workstation/Max-Q/Server} Edition` | 96 GB | pro6000 |
| `NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090` | 32 GB | rtx5090 |
| `NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090` | 24 GB | rtx4090 |

**Quick fit reference** (weights only — apply ×1.3 for real serving; pick the quant that exists):

| Total params | BF16 (×2) | FP8 (×1) | AWQ/INT4 (×0.5) |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~8B | 16 GB → 1×4090(tight)/5090 | 8 GB → 1×4090 | 4 GB → 1×4090 |
| ~30B | 60 GB → 1×H100/Pro6000 | 30 GB → 1×5090(tight)/Pro6000 | 15 GB → 1×4090(tight)/5090 |
| ~70B | 140 GB → 1×H200/2×H100 | 70 GB → 1×H100/Pro6000 | 35 GB → 1×Pro6000/5090(tight) |
| ~120B | 240 GB → 2×H200/2×B200 | 120 GB → 1×B200/2×H100 | 60 GB → 1×H100/Pro6000 |
| ~235B | 470 GB → 4×B200 | 235 GB → 2×B200/4×H100 | ~120 GB → 1×B200/2×H100 |
| ~400B+ | 800 GB → 8×B200 | 400 GB → 4×B200/8×H100 | ~200 GB → 2×B200/4×H100 |

## Step 5 — Hardware → model matrix (the deliverable)

Present a table mapping each target GPU config to the promising model(s) that fit, with the quant and a one-line
why. Cover the spectrum — small flagships on consumer cards, mid-size on Pro6000/H100, large MoE on H200/B200
(single or tensor-parallel). Example shape:

| Hardware | gpu_count | Recommended model (quant) | Why it's promising | Fit note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RTX 4090 / 5090 | 1 | `<8B model>` (AWQ/FP8) | strong small-model Elo, hot on HF | ~Xgb, fits one card |
| RTX PRO 6000 | 1 | `<30–70B>` (FP8) | benchmark wins, reputable lab | ~Xgb of 96 |
| H100 80GB | 1–2 | `<70–120B MoE>` (FP8) | top arena Elo, high HF trend | TP2 for context headroom |
| H200 141GB | 1 | `<120B>` (FP8) | flagship, loud online | fits 1×, long context |
| B200 | 1–8 | `<235–400B+ MoE>` (FP8/NVFP4) | SOTA open, high demand | TPn across the node |

Flag any model with **no engine support yet** or **no suitable quant** as "watch, revisit" rather than slotting it.

## Step 6 — Return the lifecycle manifest

When lifecycle mode is requested, produce exactly the JSON shape in the prompt and no prose or Markdown fence. If the
prompt supplies a manifest path, use `write_file` to store the JSON there before the final response. Each new
onboarding row needs the exact target, `generate` or `embed`, and a brief evidence-backed rationale. Empty
`best_effort_models`, `obsolete_models`, and `onboarding_models` lists are valid when the complete partition permits
them. Do not edit recipe files yourself: the workflow validates exact model IDs, the maintained count, the complete
lifecycle partition, active replacements for obsolete recipes, target hardware, duplicates, and rationale before
making any change.

## Step 7 — Hand off in survey mode

For each (model, hardware) pair the user wants to pursue, offer to invoke **`onboard-model`** — pass the
`hf_id` and the chosen GPU + `gpu_count`. That skill does the real work (engine/image research, recipe, validate,
benchmark within time caps). Don't reimplement any of it here.

If the user just wanted the survey, stop at the matrix.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- **Don't rank by downloads alone** — it's lagging and size-biased (tiny fine-tuning bases dominate). `trending`
  + arena `elo` + Step-2 hype together are the demand signal.
- **Don't size MoE by active params.** VRAM follows TOTAL params; active params only set throughput.
- **Don't assign a GPU tier without checking the quant exists.** "Fits H100 at FP8" is meaningless if only a
  BF16 repo is published. Verify the AWQ/FP8/NVFP4 repo on HF first.
- **Don't treat a blank arena Elo as "bad".** It usually means the model is too new for the last weekly arena
  snapshot — lean on HF `trending` + news there.
- **Don't spam the script.** HF rate-limits bursts; use `--workers 4` and re-run sparingly (transient failures
  land in the script's "COULD NOT VERIFY" bucket — wait and re-run, don't hammer).
- **Don't deploy or edit recipes in this skill.** The automated workflow applies a validated lifecycle manifest;
  `onboard-model` owns real deployment and qualification.
- **Don't forget overhead.** The fit table is weights-only; real serving needs ~1.3× for activations + KV, more
  for long context / high concurrency.
