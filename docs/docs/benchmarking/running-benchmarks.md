# Running Benchmarks

For a beginner-friendly walkthrough of Emmy's two benchmarking workflows—including local PyTorch comparisons,
profiling, fair-experiment rules, recipe dry runs, and result files—see
[Benchmarking and Comparing Emmy](../course/benchmarking_emmy).

Emmy lets you run standardized benchmarks across different GPU types and model configurations,
so you can find the best performance-to-cost ratio before committing to a deployment.

## Metrics

Each benchmark captures:

- **Throughput** — tokens per second (TPS)
- **Time to first token (TTFT)**
- **Inter-token latency (ITL)**
- **GPU memory utilization**
- **Cost per 1M tokens** (based on CloudRift GPU pricing)

## Running a benchmark

Select a recipe or custom configuration, choose one or more GPU types, and launch.
Results are saved automatically and can be [shared as experiments](../experiments/overview).
