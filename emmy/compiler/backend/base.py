"""Backend abstraction for compiling and running a ``Graph``.

A Backend lowers a ``Graph`` to a backend-specific runnable artifact and
executes it. Each backend (NumPy, Loop, CUDA, ...) implements this
interface; all backends share the same call surface:

    compiled = backend.compile(graph)
    result, pre = backend.run(compiled, input_data={...})
    outputs    = result.outputs   # dict[name, ndarray]
    elapsed    = result.time_ms

``run()`` always returns a 2-tuple ``(RunResult, T | None)``. ``T`` is
whatever the optional ``pre_run`` callback returned; with no callback
it is ``None``. ``pre_run`` runs once before the backend executes the
graph and inside whatever serialization the backend uses
(``gpu_lock()`` on the CUDA backend) — accuracy tests use this to
compute a torch eager reference on the same GPU window the emmy
launches will see, so peer-worker CUDA activity can't interleave
between the eager forward and the emmy comparison.

Individual backends may do different internal lowerings: the CUDA backend
calls ``run_pipeline`` through the full chain (decomposition →
optimization → fusion → lowering/tile → lowering/cuda), the Loop
backend stops after fusion, and the numpy backend walks the graph
directly. From the caller's perspective the interface is identical.
