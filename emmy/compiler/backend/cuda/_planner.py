"""Liveness-based memory planning for the CUDA runtime allocator.

The backend lowers a whole program (e.g. a 28-layer transformer) to a flat list
of kernel launches in topological order. Naively each graph node's output gets
its own permanently-live device buffer — so every layer's ``[heads, S, S]``
attention scratch stays resident at once (~29 GB for Qwen3-Embedding at S=4096 →
cupy OOM). But a *scratch* buffer is live only from the launch that writes it
until the last launch that reads it; two scratch buffers whose live intervals
don't overlap can share the same memory.

These pure helpers compute those live intervals and pack the scratch buffers into
one slab (offset per buffer) via a greedy-by-size memory planner (the strategy
TFLite's ``GreedyMemoryPlanner`` uses). They take no cupy and no graph — only the
launch list + sizes — so they unit-test on a CPU box. ``program.py`` turns the
offsets into typed views over one persistent ``cupy`` slab.

Input/constant/output buffers are NOT planned here: inputs are uploaded (and read
across the whole call), outputs are sliced out at the end, constants are weights —
all persistent. Only ``role == "scratch"`` buffers are reuse candidates.

    """Per scratch buffer, its half-open live interval ``[first_write, free_at)``
    over the topological launch order (``launches`` is already topo-sorted).

    - ``first_write`` = index of the launch whose ``node_id`` is the buffer (one
      buffer is produced by exactly one launch).
    - ``free_at`` = ``last_read + 1``, where ``last_read`` is the highest launch
      index that *reads* the buffer. A launch reads buffer ``b`` when ``b`` is one
      of its ``arg_names`` (kernel params) OR the ``src_buf`` of one of its TMA
      descriptors (a TMA-loaded buffer appears as the descriptor name in
      ``arg_names``, not the buffer name — so its source must be counted
      explicitly or the buffer would look dead and be aliased while still read).

    The half-open ``+1`` (free strictly after last use) is load-bearing: a launch
    at index ``i`` produces its output (interval starts at ``i``) while reading its
    inputs (each input's ``free_at >= i+1``), so the overlap test in
    :func:`plan_offsets` always treats an input live at ``i`` and the output born
    at ``i`` as overlapping — a launch's output can never alias its own live input.

    Raises on a scratch buffer with no producer or no consumer (a lowering-contract
    violation — surfaced loudly rather than silently leaked/mis-aliased).
