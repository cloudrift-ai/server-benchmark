"""Per-compilation context passed through the rewrite pipeline.

A ``Context`` carries target-derived state (``compute_capability``) and
any future per-compilation knobs (tuning params, flags) that rules need
to read. Built once per ``run_pipeline`` invocation and threaded through
the engine; rules that take a ``ctx`` parameter receive it via the same
dispatcher binding that supplies ``graph`` / ``match`` / ``root``.

This replaces process-global access patterns like the ``_OVERRIDE``
module state in :mod:`emmy.compiler.target`: explicit-by-design
keeps tests simple (no monkey-patching), keeps compilations independent
(no cross-thread state), and makes rule dependencies discoverable from
the signature alone.
