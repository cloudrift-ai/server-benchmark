"""Base Op class and boundary sentinels shared across every IR level.

``Op`` is the root of all tensor operations. ``InputOp`` and ``ConstantOp``
are boundary sentinels that carry tensors into the graph without computing
anything — they appear unchanged from the frontend stage all the way through
to fusion, and the numpy backend supplies their values at runtime.

The shared base for body-carrying ops (``LoopOp`` / ``KernelOp`` /
``TileOp``) lives in :mod:`emmy.compiler.ir.body_op` — split out to
avoid a circular import with the ``ir.stmt`` package (which imports
``Stage`` from ``ir.tile.ir`` for normalization).

``_keepdim_axis`` is a small shape helper used by both ``ReduceOp`` (minimal IR,
``tensor.py``) and ``MeanOp`` (frontend IR, ``frontend.py``). Keeping it here
avoids a frontend→tensor dependency for a single function.

    ``source`` is the predecessor op in any rewrite chain — the engine

    full path back through ``KernelOp → TileOp → LoopOp`` (or any other

    absorb a foldable op (``TransposeOp``, ``ReshapeOp``, ...) into this
    chain, so a chain of layout ops over a constant collapses to a single
    ``ConstantOp`` whose loader executes the chain via the reference

    - ``value`` — a **static** scalar fixed at trace/compile time (eps, scale, a folded dim).
    - ``context_value`` — a **runtime** scalar bound at launch from the context (the
      ``sym_values`` symbolic-dim env) via an :class:`~emmy.compiler.ir.expr.Expr` over
      symbolic-dim names; e.g. a dynamic mean's divisor = the runtime reduce-axis size
      (``Var("seq_len")``). The backend fills the buffer with ``float(expr.eval(sym_values))``
      per run.
    - **neither** — an **executor-supplied** tensor (weights / RoPE tables loaded from
      safetensors, or fed as ``input_data``).
