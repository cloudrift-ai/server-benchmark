"""Loop IR — one ``LoopOp`` is one GPU kernel's worth of loop-nest compute.

After fusion, each ``LoopOp`` describes the compute for one GPU kernel as
an SSA program over a named iteration space:

    body              : Body   — SSA body: Assign | Accum | Write | Select | Loop | Load
    axes              : computed property  — iteration space walked from body's Loop tree
    reduce_axis_names : computed property  — names of axes whose Loop wraps an Accum
    loads             : computed property  — body-form Load stmts (external reads)
    accums            : computed property  — unique Accum stmts, first-use order
    input_bufs        : computed property  — distinct Load.source names (in first-use order)
    num_inputs        : computed property  — len(input_bufs)
    analyze()         : LoopMeta           — precomputed name → def / scope / reduce-axis / live-axes
    __iter__          : Iterator[Stmt]     — pre-order walk (via ``iter_body``)

Iteration is explicit via ``Loop(axis, body)`` statements. Each ``Loop``
is one iteration dimension; ``Loop.body`` runs ``axis.extent`` times.
Reduce-kind Loops fold ``Accum`` statements into the accumulator named
by each ``Accum.name``. Free-kind Loops run in parallel with no
accumulator folding. Reading top-to-bottom matches execution order.

SSA names defined by ``Assign`` / ``Select`` / ``Load`` inside a
``Loop.body`` are scoped to that body — only accumulator state crosses
Loop boundaries (via ``Accum``). Invariants (unique names, defined-
before-use, accumulator liveness) are enforced by ``LoopOp.__post_init__``
(which also runs ``normalize_body`` to canonicalize the body).

Free-function companions (used by passes that work on raw
``Body``): ``iter_body`` (pre-order generator),
``map_body`` (transformer supporting ``Stmt | None | Iterable[Stmt]``),
``Stmt.rewrite(rename_ssa, sigma)`` (per-stmt SSA / Expr rewrite).
