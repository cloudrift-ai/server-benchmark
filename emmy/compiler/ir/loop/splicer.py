"""Worklist-driven splicer for a DAG of ``LoopOp``s.

Three public entry points wrap the same underlying ``_Splicer``:

- :func:`splice_loop_ops` — pairwise producer / consumer helper.
- :func:`splice_loops` — tag-generic N-way: caller supplies ``loops``
  (tag → ``LoopOp``), ``splice_edges`` ((origin_tag, src) →
  (target_tag, target_output)), and ``input_remap``. Sink is derived
  as the one tag that never appears as a splice target.
- :func:`splice_graph` — consumes a ``Graph`` fragment directly;
  classifies each Load by its node.inputs edge (LoopOp → splice,
  otherwise → external slot in first-seen order).

Algorithm. Seed: every ``Write`` of the sink loop. Each iteration pops
one pending dep and emits its def, queueing that def's own deps.
Resolution dispatches on stmt kind:

- **Load on a splice edge** — emit a copy alias at the demand scope;
  σ is solved by pairing target's ``Write.index`` against the reader's
  σ-substituted index, and the target's ``Write.value`` is queued under
  the solved σ. The target's expression chain reconstructs piecemeal.
- **Accum** — freshen its reduce axis, place
  ``Loop(fresh_reduce_axis, Accum(...))`` at
  ``_scope_for_axes(ref_scope, required_c_axes)``, queue the Accum's
  ``value`` under σ extended with the fresh reduce binding.
- **Plain Assign / Select / Load** (non-splice source) — ``rewrite``
  the original stmt through ``(rename_ssa, sigma)`` and insert at the
  demand scope.

Unified dedup. A single table keyed on
``(origin, name, emit_scope, σ.restrict(live_axes))`` decides whether
to share an existing emission or allocate a fresh one. ``live_axes``
comes from ``LoopMeta`` and is the set of axes transitively reachable
through the stmt's Expr subtrees — σ bindings outside that set are
irrelevant and collapsed. Same key → share; different emit scope or
different live-σ → emit twice. This handles plain-stmt sharing, Accum
scope multiplicity (SDPA QK^T at softmax-max vs softmax-output), and
multi-output splice targets uniformly.

``LoopBuilder.insert`` is pure tree-splicing: descend the body along
the enclosure path, creating ``Loop`` nodes if missing, prepend at the
leaf. The worklist resolves deps in reverse-topological order so
consumers demand before producers — that *usually* yields defined-
before-use. The exception is the dedup case: when a stmt's operand
hits an existing binding emitted earlier in the worklist, the new stmt
still prepends above the existing one — landing above its own dep.
That sibling inversion is fixed up by the generic
``topo_sort_siblings`` pass in :mod:`emmy.compiler.ir.stmt.normalize`,
which runs inside ``LoopOp.__post_init__`` — so the splicer doesn't
need its own ordering pass; constructing the ``LoopOp`` is enough.
