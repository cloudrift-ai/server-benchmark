"""The carrier algebra — the decoupled reduce carrier.

The algebra of a kernel is **in the body**: the fold ``⊕`` is a :class:`Carrier` (state + a
ψ-conjugated :class:`Twist`) that rides on the reduce ``Loop`` it folds through (``loop.carrier``).
A contraction (matmul) is just a reduce ``Loop`` whose ``AxisRole`` is ``CONTRACTION`` — the ``⊗``
lift sits in the loop body, recognized structurally on demand, never stored as a node kind. The
old ``Monoid`` / ``Semiring`` op-tree node *wrappers* are retired; passes read the structure
(the annotated loop + its carrier) directly. These primitives are consolidated here so the
algebra lives in one place:

- :class:`State` / :class:`Twist` / :class:`Carrier` — the loop-carried associative combine (⊕).
- :class:`StateMerge` — the renderable cross-partition state⊕state combine a carrier emits.

The lift / projection wrapper itself — :class:`~emmy.compiler.ir.tile.ir.Map` — is a
*tile-IR* op-tree node (it carries the kernel's schedule), so it lives in ``ir/tile/ir.py``.

    the twisted combine ``x ⊕ y = ψ(ψ⁻¹(x) · ψ⁻¹(y))``. The twist is carried here as DATA, in one
    of two modes:

    - **SPEC mode** (``family`` set, with ``channels``): the combine is generated on demand by
      :class:`Carrier` from ``(family, channels, state)`` — the inverse-ψ generator builds the
      naive combine and a per-family stabilizer recovers the numerically-stable form (see
      ``ir/stmt/carrier.py``). ``"exp"`` is online-softmax / flash's max-rescale LSE; ``"id"`` is
      the degenerate identity twist (a plain reduce). The stored program fields stay empty.
    - **BOUND mode** (``family is None``): the programs are stored verbatim — used by the one-shot
      ``Carrier.as_state_merge`` finalize, whose ``merge`` IS its ``combine_states``.

    A :class:`Carrier` reads ``carrier.merge`` / ``.combine_states`` / ``.state_b`` (the
    mode-dispatching accessors), never these fields directly.
