"""Tile IR — a map/reduce kernel with its *schedule* made explicit.

One :class:`TileOp` is the article's reduction skeleton — ``project ∘
reduce(⊕, e) ∘ map(f)`` — scheduled but not yet bound to hardware threads.
It sits between Loop IR (pure iteration) and Kernel IR (threads / smem):

    Loop IR ──lowering/tile──▶ Tile IR ──lowering/kernel──▶ Kernel IR

The whole point of the layer is the article's thesis: **the schedule is
separate from the combine.** A ``TileOp`` holds the structural-IR root ``op``
(the *combine* — the :class:`Map` / :class:`Reduction` / :class:`Contraction`
nodes defined **in this module**, alongside ``ir/stmt/algebra``) directly,
plus a thin set of **root-global schedule fields** — the free-axis → grid
:class:`~.schedule.Placement` (``place``) and the warp split (``workers``). The
per-node schedule slices ride the structural nodes themselves (a
:class:`Contraction`'s ``tile``, a :class:`Reduction`'s
``reduce`` — EVERY reduce partition rides its node, none on the ``TileOp``); the residual root fields
(``tier`` / ``stage``) hold the schedule for the not-yet-nodified forms (a non-tiled
contraction's output tile, the pin-only ``STAGE`` / ``WSPEC``; flash is now a
``Map(source=Reduction(partial=[Contraction(QK), …, Contraction(PV)]))`` node tree, so its
partition rides the node). There is no per-kind kernel/schedule type: the algebra is read
structurally off the axes' :class:`~emmy.compiler.ir.axis.AxisRole`
(``ops.axis_role``), so MAP / MONOID / SEMIRING all ride the same ``TileOp``.

The combine lives entirely in the ``op`` wrapper (the :class:`Map` /
:class:`Reduction` / :class:`Contraction` nodes here + ``ir/stmt/algebra``): a
node whose per-cell loop nest carries the role (``AxisRole``) + the decoupled
``Carrier`` (the ⊕ algebra). The algebra is **not stored as a node kind**; the
role/carrier are read off the node / annotated loop where a pass needs them
(``ops.axis_role`` / ``ops.reduce_loop``). ``lower(op)`` flattens the structural
tree back to the loop nest.

The structural nodes are the **post-schedule** skeleton a ``TileOp`` is built from:
each holds its own scheduling parameters (the contraction's :class:`~.schedule.TilePlan`)
plus its algebra params, with the derived geometry exposed as ``@property`` (so
``structural_key`` digests only the compact param fields and the ``--ir`` dumps stay
readable). The kernel materializer reads the schedule straight off the node — it never
re-recognizes structure the tile IR already holds.

    Holds the structural-IR root ``op`` (a :class:`Map` /
    :class:`Reduction` / :class:`Contraction`, or ``None`` for a
    placeholder node) plus the schedule fields — not a pre-lowered body. The per-cell loop-IR
    body is generated at materialize time by ``lower(op)``, and a bare reduction / contraction's
    output ``Write`` is glue generated there too (from ``place.grid`` + the graph node's output
    buffer; see ``lowering/kernel/010_materialize``). ``inputs`` / ``outputs`` come from the base
    :meth:`Op.populate_io` (graph edges) — no body walk.

    Schedule fields (all defaulted, so a fresh / placeholder node is well-formed):

    - ``place`` — the free-axis → grid binding (:class:`~.schedule.Placement`); root-global.
    - ``workers`` — the warp-specialization split (:class:`~.schedule.WarpSpec`); root-global, ``None`` =

      contraction; a tiled contraction rides its ``tile`` on the ``Contraction`` node. ``None`` = per-cell.
    - ``stage`` — the operand smem pipeline (:class:`~.schedule.Stage`); ``None`` = gmem-direct.

    There is **no** residual reduce-partition field: EVERY partitioned reduce — a plain / twisted
    monoid, flash, a coop-K / split-K contraction — carries its :class:`~.schedule.ReducePlan` on its
    ``Reduction`` node (read via ``ops.reduce_plan``); the flat-``Map`` coop-K contraction is nodified
    by ``ops.nodify_reduce`` at schedule / split time. The contraction operand→role binding is not a
    ``TileOp`` field either — a tiled contraction carries its A/B operands / accumulator / epilogue on
