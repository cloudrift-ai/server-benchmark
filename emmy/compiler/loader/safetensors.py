"""Read parameters/buffers straight from safetensors shards.

This bypasses the PyTorch ``nn.Module`` round-trip: given a model id (HF
repo) or a local directory of safetensors files, the loader resolves
each ``ConstantOp.source_path`` to a tensor in one of the shards, reads
it as a numpy array, and runs the recorded ``load_ops`` chain via the
NumPy backend.

The function keeps a small key-canonicalization table because HF
checkpoints sometimes carry a ``model.`` prefix that ``torch.export``
strips, and vice versa. We try the original name, then with ``model.``
added, then with ``model.`` removed — that covers every case we've
seen on Llama / Qwen / TinyLlama.
