# Pipeline Architecture

A pattern-based rewrite engine over a frozen pass layout, plus the autotune search and dump hooks. This file covers the
engine and the search; the pass-authoring invariants live in [`passes/ARCHITECTURE.md`](passes/ARCHITECTURE.md), and what
each IR dialect looks like is in `ir/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Modules

The engine core is `pipeline.py` (`Pattern` / `Match` / `Rule` / `Pass` / `Pipeline` for the frozen layout, plus `Run` —
the per-run state and engine loop) and `fork.py` (the `Fork` interface with `OptionFork` / `ThunkFork`, and the reusable
`Level` + `build_fork_tree` lazy knob-cartesian tree builder). `knob.py` owns the `Knob` descriptor system and the
`EMMY_<KNOB>` env namespace (it borrows `config.knob_var` / `config.knob_raw`; `format_tuning_knobs` renders the
real tuning knobs for `tune` output) — but **not** the concrete knob declarations. **INVARIANT: every `Knob` instance is
declared in `search/space.py` and nowhere else** — the single home for the whole search space: the knob declarations (the
schedule codecs `REDUCE` / `TILE` / `STAGE` / `WSPEC`, the pin-only structural `PLACE`, and the kernel-lowering policy
knobs `VECTORIZE_LOADS` / `INTERLEAVE_LOADS`) **and** the enumeration value grids (`scalar_tile_moves` & co). A rule that
decides a knob imports it from `search/space.py` rather than declaring its own; `knob.registry()` still discovers them by
walking loaded modules (`space.py` loads at pipeline startup via those rules). The featurizers (`knob_features`,
`tile_signature`, the `D_*` / `MMA_*` encodings) live beside it in `search/features.py`, so the whole space — dimensions ×
values × encoding — is analyzable in one package. `dump.py` and `rule_diff.py` are the dump / `-vv` presentation layers.

The autotune state lives under `search/`. The persistent store is `SearchDB` (`db.py`, SQLite). The in-memory MCTS lives
with its only reader, `TuningSearch`, in `policy/mcts.py` (greedy compiles use `policy/greedy.greedy_decide` instead, no
tree). `two_level.py` is the two-level tuner (outer structural MCTS, inner per-op reward). The ONE ranking path is
`prior/`: a `Prior` ABC with the cold `AnalyticPrior` and the learned `CatBoostPrior` composed behind `FallbackPrior`
(`load_prior`). `data/` is the harmonized read-view over the three data sources (golden configs / DB `perf` rows / prior
reservoir) — `Sample`, `Dataset`, and `ShapeKey` (the single golden↔measured join key). `golden.py` holds
`GoldenConfig` and its matmul / attention / softmax / reduce / rms_norm / pointwise subclasses (the `AnalyticPrior`'s ground truth); every kind carries
`shape_key()` / `snippet()` / `dtype`, so `tune --dataset golden` and the `run --bench --golden` A/B cover the reduce /
pointwise entries too, not just matmul. The A/B itself carries two integrity gates — an arithmetic-intensity floor
(a row whose shape-implied FLOP/s exceeds the live card's recorded `GpuSpec` peak is flagged as a wrong bench, not a
fast kernel) and a wrong-answer check (each pinned config executes once on the greedy run's inputs and its outputs are
compared, catching the silently-wrong `g2a` skipped-finalize class) — plus `--json PATH`, a machine-readable record of
the whole comparison (backends / greedy kernels / pinned rows with their flags) so sweep judgments trace to flagged
fields instead of parsed terminal text. Golden rows attach to the run's SHAPE, not a kernel node: a pinned row whose
shape matches no greedy kernel (greedy deployed a split partial+finalize pair) still prints and lands in the record.
`keys.py` defines
`op_cache_key` / `dialect_of` / `source_chain`; `slice.py` isolates one finalized kernel into a standalone graph;
`diagnostics.py` (under `prior/`) backs the `eval` reachability / calibration reports.

The passes themselves are `passes/{frontend,loop,lowering}/`. Each pass directory's rules and invariants are documented
in [`passes/ARCHITECTURE.md`](passes/ARCHITECTURE.md); the per-pass overview table is near the end of this file.

## Engine

### Chain matcher

A `Pattern(name, op_type, constraints={})` matches one node by op type plus optional `node.op` field equality. A pattern
list matches a chain: the seed matches `pattern[0]`, its sole consumer matches `pattern[1]`, and so on. Multi-node
patterns only fire when each intermediate node has exactly one consumer.

`match_pattern(graph, pattern) → list[Match]` walks every topo-ordered seed; overlaps between matches are allowed (the
rewriter exits after the first successful rewrite per iteration, so overlap is just candidate enumeration). `Match.nodes`
maps each pattern entry's name to the matched `Node`. `Match.consumed` and `Match.output` are overridable by the rewrite
function to control which nodes the splicer removes and which node's edges get rewired.

### Rule module convention

Every file named `NNN_<name>.py` under a pass directory is a rule:

```python
PATTERN = [Pattern("root", SomeOp), ...]   # required
def rewrite(ctx: Context, graph: Graph, match: Match) -> Graph | Op | list[Graph | Op]:
    ...
```

The dispatcher binds parameters by name. Reserved names: `graph`, `match`, `root`, `out`, `ctx`. Pattern names from
`PATTERN` bind to matched `Node` objects. Anything else binds positionally to `root.inputs[i]`. Take only what you need —
`ctx` is optional. Files starting with `_` (e.g. `_broadcast.py`) are **not** loaded as rules — they're shared helpers.

The return type discriminates the rewrite flavor:

- **Functional** — returns a `Graph` fragment, spliced in place of `match.output` (defaults to `match.root_node_id`);
  fragment `InputOp` nodes reference existing graph nodes by id, non-Input nodes get fresh ids.
- **In-place** — returns an `Op`. The engine assigns it to `root.op` directly, preserving the node id, inputs list,
  output Tensor, and hints. Used by the lowering rules because `KernelOp.arg_order` / `CudaOp.arg_order` embed the
  original node id as the output buffer name, so a fresh id would break the generated kernel's buffer binding.
- **List = autotune fork.** A rule unsure which parameter to use returns the alternatives as a list, in any order — the
  engine spawns one `LazyCandidate` per option (sharing the parent's graph snapshot) and hands them ALL to a `Search`
  policy, which ranks them via a `Prior` (see below). Single-option returns (or a bare `Graph` / `Op`) are the
  deterministic case — no fork.

Raise `RuleSkipped(reason)` to decline a match — the engine logs the reason at DEBUG and moves on.

**Idempotence requirement.** Every rule MUST be idempotent on its own output. The engine re-runs the entire pipeline on
each popped candidate from pass 0; rules whose output is already in the graph must `RuleSkipped` or have a pattern that
no longer matches. Most rules satisfy this implicitly via op-type changes (`LoopOp` → `TileOp`); the rest have explicit
`raise RuleSkipped("already X")` guards.

### Forks and the one ranking path

Ranking is always the policy's job over a single `Prior` — Forks carry NO score, and nothing materializes or scores a
`TileOp` just to rank it (the per-variant `lazy_score` / `score_tile_geometry` formulas, the `Fork.score` /
`Search.score_of` plumbing, the DB-best `_best_fork` replay, and the `_priority_*` enumeration sort are all gone). The
`Prior` featurizes the row knobs directly (`features.knob_features`). There is ONE ranking path: the hand-coded
`AnalyticPrior` cold (a real heuristic *score* over the engineered `D_*` geometry / occupancy features, not emission
order; a separate `_W_A_DYN` weight set ranks symbolic-axis masked-tile kernels, selected on the stamped
`S_ext_n_symbolic_axis`; two hard-coded interaction gates ride outside the linear weights — the atomic-free split-K
term, and the tensor-core preference pair `D_scalar_on_warp_eligible` / `D_splitk_roundtrip` off the scheduler's
per-kernel `S_warp_eligible` row stamp, which stops a warp-eligible f16 contraction deploying a scalar split tile)
and the learned `CatBoostPrior` once trained, composed behind `FallbackPrior`. `TuningSearch`
(`tune`) ranks the PUCT frontier; `greedy_decide` (`compile` / `run`, via `Run.resolve`) picks via `Prior.pick` —
measured -O3 reservoir evidence first (`evidence_pick`: the candidate prefix-consistent with the fastest `H_opt=3` row of
the same op), the `mean_score` argmin otherwise.

`FallbackPrior` splits its two surfaces once the learned half is **trustworthy** — fitted AND passing the **calibration
gate** (`Prior.trustworthy`): after every fit, `maybe_refit` measures the median per-op in-sample Spearman between the
model's predictions and its own reservoir labels (`_reservoir_calibration`, persisted in the checkpoint); below
`CALIBRATION_MIN` the model is quarantined — it keeps training and checkpointing, but deploys, PUCT, and structural
pricing (`greedy._pick_structural`) stay analytic, and the verdict is logged. `fitted` alone let a mis-calibrated model
own deploys silently (the 2026-07 RTX 5090 sweeps); in-sample Spearman is a lenient tripwire that specifically catches
the model-and-rows-don't-share-a-feature-vocabulary collapse (constant predictions, worse-than-random ranking). When
trusted: `mean_score` / `mean_scores` / `pick` (deploy +
eval) are pure-learned + evidence, but `score` — the MCTS *selection* signal — tilts the learned µs by the analytic's
dimensionless ranking multiplier (`learned · analytic**W`, `W = config.analytic_tilt`, neutral 1.0), so PUCT still
explores a region the cold heuristic prices well but the data-poor learned model buries.

**Featurizer vocabulary versioning.** `features.FEATURIZER_VERSION` stamps every persisted training artifact: the prior
checkpoint (`to_json`; `from_json` discards a checkpoint from another version WHOLE — model and reservoir rows alike,
since rows spelled in a retired knob vocabulary featurize to garbage and a refit on them collapses to constant
predictions) and the autotune DB's `node` rows (a `feat_ver` column, additively migrated; `diagnostics.node_report`
excludes rows from another version with a printed count — pre-stamp rows default to version 1, the retired pre-rebuild
vocabulary, and quarantine conservatively). Bump the constant on any incompatible knob-spelling or feature-encoding
change; artifacts from the old vocabulary then age out instead of poisoning the model.

**Lazy hierarchical forks.** `Fork` (`fork.py`) is an interface: `knobs` (the knob delta the fork pins — the variant
identity the perf DB and prior key on, read without expanding), `is_leaf`, and `expand()` (the next level of options).
The search loop pops a Fork-pending `LazyCandidate`, invokes `expand()` to materialize the children, pushes them back,
and continues; only the subtrees the search walks into get materialized. `OptionFork` is a concrete `Op` / `Graph` leaf;
`ThunkFork` is a generic flat fork (`expand_fn(knobs)` a function of the fork's own delta, so siblings share one
function). Multi-level knob-cartesian forks reuse `build_fork_tree`: a rule supplies the per-level `Level`s + a
`materialize=` callable and gets back a lazy ROOT `_Branch` whose `expand()` builds children on demand in grouping order.

**Knob-stamp invariant.** Every emitted variant carries an explicit value for every declared knob — no realized leaf has
an absent knob. Each `Knob` declares an `off` value (its "unused / declined" sentinel), and the pipeline fills any of a
pass's declared knobs the variant left unspecified at the **pass boundary** (`Cursor.advance` → `_off_fill_pass`, via
`knob.apply_off_defaults`), covering a pass that acted, declined, was skipped, or returned no variants alike. Scoping the
fill to the just-finished pass avoids prematurely stamping a later pass's knob (which would trip that pass's idempotency
guard). The point: the learned prior NaN-fills absent feature columns, so with explicit OFF values NaN means *only*
"not-yet-decided" (a partial fork prefix during descent), distinct from "decided: unused" (an OFF value on a complete
leaf). A knob with no `off` (the `_UNSET` default — a knob its owning pass always stamps itself) is never
auto-filled. Tier discrimination is value-based throughout (`knob.is_warp` / `knob.mma_atom`). Verified by
`tests/compiler/passes/test_knob_stamp_invariant.py`.

**Validate / raise as fork pruning.** A rewrite that *returns* an op failing `Op.validate(ctx)` (e.g. a `KernelOp` whose
smem exceeds `ctx.max_dynamic_smem`) is filtered by `Candidate.try_rewrite` — correct as fork pruning (sibling branches
carry other tile shapes) but fatal in a single-path greedy compile, where it leaves the node un-lowered. `Pipeline.run`
installs a `rejections` sink on the `Run` recording each drop `(node, pass, reason)`; after the terminal settles,
`_raise_on_unlowered` raises a loud `LoweringError` naming any still-un-lowered node instead of leaking a cryptic
`non-CudaOp` `TypeError` to the backend. The sink is absent under `tune`, so the fork-pruning path stays silent. A
rewrite that *raises* mid-lowering (a deterministic pass hitting an un-representable shape) is the same dead end for an
exception: greedy `resolve` lets it propagate; under `tune`, `Run.drive` catches it per-candidate, drops that subtree,
and bumps `Run._dropped_candidates` — without this, one search-only un-lowerable fork aborted the whole tune.

### Tile lowering at the pipeline level

`lowering/tile/` lowers each fused `LoopOp` to a kernel-ready `TileOp` over the block-DAG Tile IR (`ir/tile/ir.py`):
`010_recognize` (lift `LoopOp` → `TileOp`, recognize flash / softmax carriers, annotate each reduce `Loop` with its
`AxisRole` + `Carrier`, then schedule inline via the `_schedule` helper — no separate `020` pass:
map free axes to the grid, pick the reduce partition + output `TILE` fragment, and **atomize** — resolve the
algebra→hardware-atom binding structurally onto the schedule as each warp / cooperative option is built, so an unbindable
atom is rejected at fork construction; `_atomize.py`, see [`passes/ARCHITECTURE.md`](passes/ARCHITECTURE.md)) → `030_split`
(cross-CTA split-K as a graph rewrite). It **never dispatches on a named shape** — every decision is gated on the reduce axes' carrier algebra read
off the body (`MAP` / `SEMIRING` / `MONOID`; flash attention is the `MONOID` algebra on the streaming schedule, a twisted
monoid is a monoid, selected structurally), not on a matmul / pointwise / attention archetype. The full design lives in
[`passes/ARCHITECTURE.md`](passes/ARCHITECTURE.md). Two interactions reach up to the pipeline level:

**Demoted-matmul split (`CUT`) as an outer structural fork.** `split/010_split_demoted` may un-fuse a demoted matmul (a
multiply operand reading a computed / K-folded cone that keeps the matmul off the warp tier) into an `xn`-producer +
clean-gemm-consumer `Graph` fragment — a kernel-set change. The two-level tuner owns the offer as an outer structural
fork: keep-vs-split branches the outer tree, each side's kernels are tuned in first-class per-op slices, and the
Σ-per-op terminal rewards compare the kernel sets; greedy deploys the split only via the *trained* prior's structural
pricing, never cold. The `op.knobs` `CUT` stamp is the considered-vs-declined idiom (`keys.py`): simultaneously the
rule's idempotence guard, the learned prior's training signal (absent = never offered → NaN-filled; `"0"` / `"1"` = the
decision), and the `op_cache_key` separation that keeps each decision state distinct in the search tree. The stamp is
deterministic per offer site, so identical kernels across graphs stamp identically and keep sharing perf rows.

**The reusable Fork-tree builder.** The tree-building algorithm (group params by per-level knob keys, collapse
single-key levels, skip empty-key levels, defer leaf materialization to `expand()`) lives in `fork.py` as `Level` +
`build_fork_tree`. Rules with multi-level knob-cartesian forks reuse it; one-shot flat forks stay inline as `ThunkFork`s.

### Drivers

`Pipeline.build(passes)` wraps a pass list; the result exposes the compile entry points, each driving one of the `Run`
engine loops (`drive` for exploration, `resolve` for deterministic resolution):

- `Pipeline.run(graph, *, backend=None, db=None) -> Graph` — single-shot greedy compile: a deterministic resolution
  (`Run.resolve`) with the greedy pick (`greedy_decide`), NOT a search — no frontier, no tree, no benching. The decide
  flattens each fork point to its complete leaves (`fork.flatten_leaves`) and picks the `Prior`'s `mean_scores` argmin —
  `AnalyticPrior` cold, `CatBoostPrior` once trained; option-0 (first leaf, emission order) only if the prior fails to
  load entirely. The graph is copied once per attempt and resolved in place — no per-fork copies. **Structural options
  are priced, never raw-scored**: with the trained prior loaded, `greedy_decide`'s `_pick_structural` prices each side
  (a nested `resolve` per kernel over a `lowering/tile`-only pipeline, the price being the `score` of its slice-resolve's
  partition-fork `Decision`, memoized per `op_cache_key`) and the cheaper kernel set wins, so an unpinned compile deploys
  the splits `tune` measured best. The nested resolve carries the deploy's `db`, so each kernel's price follows the same
  evidence hierarchy as a knob pick (reservoir -O3, then the -O1 ranking lane, model prediction only where unmeasured) —
  a pure Σ-of-predictions comparison is exposed to the model's absolute-µs error, which doesn't cancel across different
  kernel families. Cold, or when a side is unpriceable, the structural leaf is filtered — a cold compile never changes
  kernel sets. Both evidence joins are **drift-tolerant** (`Prior.sig_groups` — one contract for the reservoir -O3
  tier and the DB tier): a candidate's fork-time `S_*` base may carry
  scheduler stamps the persisted perf rows predate (#311's `S_warp_eligible` is on no row recorded before it), and a
  strict-equality signature join would let one added feature silently disable the whole evidence lane against every
  existing DB — the ninth-4090-sweep `mlp_gate_up` misdeploy (the model's `g2k` pick beating the measured-faster fused
  config it was never allowed to see). The index spans three context twins (the deploy's own flags, the `-Xcicc -O1`
  ranking lane, the `-Xcicc -O3` lane where the tune's deployable re-benches land) and the pick is two-tier: a
  deployable-lane row decides outright; `-O1` rows decide only when no candidate has deployable evidence, because an
  -O1 median is a ranking signal with -O3 inversions and must not override a well-trained model on its own. Retries are decide-wrappers over a deterministic re-resolve (every other choice replays
  identically — cheap non-chronological backtracking, no snapshots): a structural pick that leaves a fragment kernel
  un-lowered retires structural picks wholesale and re-resolves the keep-fused branch before falling back to tile
  blocklisting.
- `async Pipeline.tune_async(graph, *, search, backend=None, db=None)` — the (async-only) autotune sweep. Pass a
  `TuningSearch(patience=, ucb_c=)`; the async generator yields one terminal `Candidate` per fully-explored rollout, and
  `tune_async` benches each via `await _bench_terminal_async` (writes per-kernel `perf` / `lowering` / inventory rows,
  returns the aggregate `PerfStats`), then calls `search.observe(stats, status)`. With `backend=None` the bench is
  stubbed to `latency_us=1.0` and nothing is persisted, so a backend-less sweep never overwrites tuned rows. A terminal
  still carrying an un-lowered kernel-bearing node (a validation-filtered rewrite) is a `bench_fail` decided before any
  bench or cache lookup — the bench sums `CudaOp`s only, so without that guard the un-lowered kernel priced at zero and
  a cached residual kernel's µs could stand in for the whole graph as an `ok` measurement (issue #327).
- `Run.drive(graph) -> Iterator[(token, Candidate)]` — the exploration engine loop (`tune`). `Run` is the per-run state
  object (`pipeline` + `ctx` + `search` + `db` + `backend` + `dump` + `rejections`): `Pipeline` stays a frozen,
  shareable pass layout while every run-scoped sink lives on the Run, reached through the candidate (`cand.run.dump`,
  `cand.ctx`). `drive` seeds the root candidate, then per iteration pops a `LazyCandidate`, resolves it, runs one rule
  batch (`Run._step`, shared with `resolve`), and pushes successors under the pop's token. Selection is `TuningSearch`'s
  job (PUCT over the learned prior); the perf DB still *records* every bench as training data. Each fork push is
  classified by effect at the spawn site (where the raw option list is concrete): any `Graph`-splicing option (a
  kernel-set change) marks the push `structural=True`; an `Op` rebind is op-variant (`False`).
- `Run.resolve(graph, decide) -> (Graph, list[Decision])` — the deterministic-resolution counterpart. Both entry points
  share one rule-batch body (`Run._step`), but `resolve` is a fold, not a search: ONE live graph mutated in place (no
  sibling snapshots, no per-fork copies — the terminal IS the seeded graph), and at each undecided fork a `decide`
  callback gets a `ForkPoint` (the `Match`, the raw options as the rule emitted them, the pre-decision op, `ctx`) and
  returns the option to apply. The returned trace — one `Decision(rule_name, node_id, chosen_kind, knob_delta, score,
  n_options)` per decided fork — is the resolution's only process-state output: "did this compile take a structural
  pick", "what did the partition fork predict for this kernel" are trace queries, never accumulated policy attributes.

### The keying map: two identities

Everything the search stores or replays is keyed by one of TWO identities — when adding a cache or table, pick one;
don't invent a third:

- **Variant identity = `(context, knobs)`** — anything *predictive or replayable*. The `S_*` structural features
  (`loop/stamp` stamps a stmt/op histogram + loop extents + operand dtypes) make the merged knob dict a COMPLETE
  identity, so a prior is a pure function of it. The learned prior is exactly `score(features(ctx, knobs))`: the
  structural facts are already in the knob dict, so `features.knob_features` turns it straight into the model feature vector
  (the `S_*` knobs pass through; tuning knobs encode by type, `MMA` expands to atom props).
- **Measurement identity = `(ctx.structural_key, op_cache_key)`** — ground truth about *materialized leaves*: `perf`
  rows (the per-variant replay cache), op inventory (`loop_op` / `tile_op` / `kernel_op` / `cuda_op`), and two-level
  dedup. The structural `child_key` on `lowering` rows is measurement linkage (it joins the inventory), NOT a replay key.

### Search persistence: on-disk inventory vs in-memory MCTS

The autotune state is split across two cooperating modules. **`SearchDB`** (`db.py`) is a SQLite store partitioned into
the four op-inventory tables (one row per op encountered along any lowering chain, keyed by `op_cache_key`), a `lowering`
edge table (one row per rewrite hop carrying the knob delta plus a best-median upsert — `best_per_op_time` walks the
chain to resolve a pre-final op's measured cost; loop→loop source hops are skipped as structural/decision hops), a
backend-partitioned `perf` table (full stats + `backend` + `status` + `knobs` + `captured`), and a `node` table — one
row per **search-tree node** (every partial branch + leaf of a per-kernel search), keyed by `digest(context_key, gpu,
op_sig, tunable-knob set)`, carrying the full feature dict the prior sees, a value-of-position latency with a
**per-kind upsert** (branch rows keep-min — a coverage bound a faster descendant genuinely tightens; leaf rows take
the **newest measurement**, since a leaf is a re-measurement of one config and min-of-K noisy medians drifts to the
noise floor), a `parent_key` pointer, a `gpu` column, and depth bookkeeping (written by `record_nodes`). Each row also
carries **label-quality columns** (additive migration; old rows degrade to unknowns): `visits` (benched-descendant
count — the label's confidence weight, SUM-accumulated across writes and merges, unlike the write-batch `n_updates`),
`is_leaf` (a real measurement vs a min over explored descendants), `variance`/`n_samples` (the leaf's own bench
stats), `status` (`ok`/`bench_fail` — failed leaves ARE recorded with the watchdog sentinel as `value_us`, the
negative examples a search prior needs; an `ok` row is never downgraded by a later fail), `run_id`/`measured_at`
(the tune session — one id per CLI invocation — and time that produced the CURRENT `value_us`, replaced only when the
value is), and `feat_ver` (the `features.FEATURIZER_VERSION` the row's feature dict is spelled in — pre-stamp rows
default to the retired version 1 and are excluded from prior evaluation; see the featurizer-vocabulary-versioning
paragraph above). The `gpu` identity
(`Context.hardware_id`, the PCIe product name) is folded into the node key so a cross-hardware dataset never collides:
`context_key` (cc + opt) can't separate same-die SKUs (H100 vs H200 share cc + SM count), so without `gpu` their rows
would merge and the upsert would silently drop one card's data (the `H_total_mem` VRAM feature is what then lets the
prior model the difference). `node` and `perf` are content-keyed (parent-tree-independent) and survive a
`_SCHEMA_VERSION` bump; only the topology-keyed `lowering` table is dropped on mismatch.
`SearchDB.merge_nodes(src_path)` is the cross-hardware accumulation entry point: it reads another autotune DB's
`node` rows read-only and re-upserts them through the same per-kind path (direction-independent — a stale leaf
snapshot never resurrects; `visits` SUMs on a shared key), so a card's node data measured on a rented GPU (no local
CUDA) folds into one canonical DB without cross-card collision — driven by `scripts/merge_node_db.py` / the
`collect-node-data` skill, whose sweeps run ε-greedy (`remote_node_tune.py` launches the remote tune with
`--explore-eps 0.25` by default) so the collected labels and fork coverage de-correlate from the incumbent prior.

**`SearchTree`** (`policy/mcts.py`) is pure-Python in-memory MCTS state, colocated with `TuningSearch` because MCTS is
the only policy that reads it. Each tree node wraps a `LazyCandidate` and carries `visits`, `best_reward` (max reward
over the subtree's measured leaves), and a `live` counter that filters out drained subtrees. Lineage is TOKEN-THREADED,
not call-order-dependent: `pop()` returns `(token, candidate)` (the token IS the `SearchNode`), the engine pushes
children with `parent=token` and observes the terminal with the same token, so the tree stays correct however the engine
interleaves pops / pushes / observes. It is rebuilt fresh each process; cached `perf` rows ensure no re-bench on warm
starts. Greedy compiles build no tree (they don't go through a `Search`).

`_bench_terminal_async` is the only path that knows about all four parts (graph, DB, tree-through-`search.observe`,
backend). It short-circuits when every `CudaOp` in the graph already has a `perf` row for the current `(context_key,
backend)`. Otherwise it does one `await backend.benchmark_async(...)`, walks `Op.source` once to record op inventory +
lowering edges + the `perf` row per kernel, and returns the aggregate `PerfStats` for the search to score.

## Tuning workflow

The autotune loop selects one tile-lowering variant per CudaOp by repeatedly running the lowering pipeline with different
knob choices at each fork point, benching the produced kernels, and steering subsequent rollouts toward the lowest
measured latency.

### Two-level search: outer structural MCTS + inner separable per-op tuning

`emmy tune` does **not** run one MCTS over the whole graph. The pipeline applies rules sequentially, so two kinds of
fork — **op-variant** forks (tile / pad / stage choices for one kernel) and **structural** forks (which kernels exist:
fusion grouping, the demoted-matmul split) — would nest and cross-product under one global patience, starving deep ops.
The two kinds have opposite structure, so `two_level.py` splits them on the fork's *effect* (the spawn-site `Op`-rebind /
`Graph`-splice classification):

- **Outer search** (`run_two_level_tune`) drives the graph-changing passes — `frontend` + `loop` plus the pre-partition
  head of `lowering/tile` (`010_split_demoted`'s keep-vs-split offer followed by the non-forking post-split re-fusion
  aliases). A **terminal** is the state where the cursor reaches `partition_loops` with every structural fork resolved.
  Each terminal is a candidate fused graph; its **reward** is `1 / Σ best-per-op time` from the inner search,
  backpropagated by the reused `TuningSearch`. Structurally identical offer sites within one trajectory take the same
  side: `Run.drive` replays the first decision read off the trajectory's own graph (`_replay_structural_decision`), so
  the outer tree stays linear in *unique* kernels instead of `2^sites`. Fusion itself is still deterministic (no rule
  emits a multi-option fusion fork), so a graph with no structural offers yields one terminal and this reduces to "tune
  each op once, sum, assemble". The global prior also drives the outer PUCT: each terminal emits one composed Σ row per
  structural decision it realized (features `{ctx, pre-decision op knobs, decision delta}`, label = the Σ of that side's
  per-kernel bests), so a warm re-tune descends the predicted-cheaper kernel set first.
- **Inner search** (`_inner_reward_async`) tunes each finalized kernel **independently** in its own single-node slice
  (`single_node_graph`, `slice.py`) with a plain `TuningSearch` over the lowering passes only (`tile → kernel → cuda`).
  The slice keeps the root kernel + its leaf-op closure and turns every other kernel-input into a synthetic `InputOp`;
  the root op is shared **by reference**, so its body — and thus `op_cache_key` — is byte-for-byte the full-graph op's.
  One fold-aware exception: a flash fold offer site's slice CARRIES the score producer its fusion consumes
  (`_flash.fused_producer_ids` → `single_node_graph(absorb=…)`), and the absorbed producer loses its own slice — a
  synthetic-input boundary would make `try_flash` unfusable in-slice, silently degrading every tune trajectory to the
  cut (benching fragment kernels greedy deploy never picks) and leaving the fused flash fork unreachable under tune.
  Because the inner tree holds one op, MCTS explores only that op's forks with `patience` as the op's own budget —
  `Σ_k n_k` benches, never the product. **Leaves are deduped by `op_cache_key`**: 24 RMSNorm LoopOps across 24 layers
  collapse to one work unit, and the outer `total_us` accumulates `best * multiplicity` so the reward stays
  multiplicity-weighted. The progress denominator is the deduped count, so Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B's ~14 unique kernels
  show as 14/14 not 14/337.

**Separability + the structural handoff.** Op-variant forks are separable: every multi-option fork is an in-place `Op`
rebind that leaves the graph unchanged, so whole-graph time is `Σ_k t_k`. Results key structurally (`op_cache_key` =
name-invariant body+knobs digest), so a kernel tuned in its slice transfers to the assembled graph unchanged **and** is
shared across outer terminals — two fusion candidates sharing an identical op reuse its tuning (a DB hit). After the best
fusion is picked, the assembled `Graph[CudaOp]` is benched **once** for the real in-context whole-graph latency;
comparing it to the `Σ` estimate is the **separability check** — a gap exposes L2 / clock / launch coupling the isolated
benches can't see (in practice <2% for small graphs).

**Always re-run, replay from the cache.** The inner search runs for **every** op on every pass — it is never skipped on
prior effort. Replay is cheap, not gated: each benched terminal hits the per-variant `perf` cache, so an already-measured
variant is served from the DB with no GPU bench. An identical re-run (same prior) re-walks the same deterministic
trajectory → every terminal is a cache hit → zero benches and the same total. But the global learned prior keeps changing
(it refits across ops and runs), so the same patience can steer the MCTS down a *different* trajectory; re-running lets it
reach and bench the genuinely-new variants the improved prior surfaces, replaying the rest for free. (The old `op_effort`
"skip already-tuned" gate is gone — it suppressed exactly that prior-driven re-exploration.)

**Per-kernel GPU parallelism (`--gpus N` / `--devices 0,1,2`).** Because the inner search tunes each unique kernel
independently, the per-op loop fans out across GPUs. The whole tuner is async-only: `run_two_level_tune` `await`s
`_inner_reward_async` per outer terminal, which runs one coroutine per unique kernel over an `asyncio.Queue` of
`len(pool)` device-pinned `CudaBackend`s — each pops a backend, drives its op's whole inner search via
`Pipeline.tune_async`, then returns the backend. So `len(pool)` benches run at once, one per GPU. **True single-thread
asyncio**: every Python statement (lowering, DB writes, prior `add_rows` / `maybe_refit` / `checkpoint`) runs on the one
event-loop thread and yields only at the bench `await`, so the shared `db` / `prior` need no locks. Each op seeds its
`TuningSearch` by `seed + op_idx` and the reward is a commutative `Σ`, so the per-op DB bests and `total_us` are
byte-identical regardless of slot count; only the learned `prior.json` varies run-to-run (rows arrive in completion
order). The **default single-GPU** path is a one-slot pool whose coroutines acquire the lone worker in `op_idx` order —
strictly sequential, identical to the old serial loop. A backend pins its async worker to a physical GPU via the child
spawn env (`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, plus a per-device `EMMY_GPU_LOCK` suffix), never mutating the parent
`os.environ`. Parallelism is bounded by the unique-kernel count; devices must be homogeneous.

**Search dynamics.** Each level reuses the **same** SP-MCTS (`policy/mcts.py`) — outer over structural forks, inner over
one op's forks — with max-Q normalized UCB1. **Selection** is PUCT (`_select`): `score(c) = Q(c) + c · P(c) ·
√(N_parent+1)/(1+N_c)`, where `Q = best_reward/global_best` (0 if unvisited), `reward = 1/median_us`, and `P` is the
prior's predicted reward on the same scale (the prior predicts latency `û(c)`, which `_select` converts to `1/û` and
normalizes by the same `global_best` — no softmax; `c = --ucb-c`). The prior is the SOLE signal — greedy tiebreak, the
static `TileOp.score` tiebreak, and the `+∞`-unvisited UCB rule are all gone. A confidently-slow sibling (large `û` →
small `P`) is deprioritized instead of force-benched. **Expansion** is implicit (one rule batch per pop, one child per
alternative). **Simulation** is the actual `await backend.benchmark_async(...)` on the terminal. **Backprop** walks the
popped candidate's parent chain updating `visits` and `best_reward`. **Patience** counts terminals since the last new
global best; when it exceeds `--patience N` (default 50), the level exits.

### Learned prior

ONE global `CatBoostPrior` across every kernel, GPU and nvcc setting — not per-op, not partitioned by regime. Op
structure (`S_*`) and the host/hardware regime (`H_*` — GPU compute capability + nvcc opt level, from `Context.features`)
are **features in every row**, not a cache key. Training signal is **value-of-position**: real benches exist only at
leaves, but the prior ranks partial-knob siblings at every fork level, so the label for any node is the best (min) median
latency µs over its benched descendants (`1/best_reward`) — the prior regresses on **latency**, and the `1/û` conversion
lives in the MCTS `_select` loop, not the stored data. `TuningSearch._collect_rows` walks the live tree and emits
`(knobs, label)` for every node with a benched descendant. A directly-benched **leaf** uses its `realized_knobs` — the
FULL config read off the resolved graph's op in `observe` (so knobs stamped at deterministic, non-forking lowering steps
— `FK` / `BK` / `SPLITK` / `STAGE` — are captured, not just the fork knobs). A **branch** falls back to `_node_knobs`
(its partial `fork.knobs` prefix under the op's `S_*` / `H_*` base), carrying the value-of-position label.

Alongside that reservoir feed, the same finished tree is walked once by `_collect_node_records` and persisted to the
`node` SQLite table via `record_nodes` — the keyed, deduplicated, parent-linked counterpart to the unkeyed/sampled
reservoir. The walk fills the label-quality columns (see the `SearchDB` paragraph): `SearchNode.visits`, the leaf's
`bench_stats`/`bench_status` stashed by `observe`, `is_leaf` from `realized_knobs`. It also emits **`bench_fail`
leaves** (leaf-only; never value anchors — no monotone participation, children anchor past them, an all-failed branch
stays unrecorded) and, for a leaf the tune re-benched at the deployable `-Xcicc -O3` (`observe_o3` stashes
`SearchNode.o3_us`), an **-O3-regime row**: keyed under the tune context with `O3_NVCC_FLAGS` substituted (never
colliding with the -O1 twin), features stamped `H_opt=3.0` (the reservoir convention), parentless (a regime
re-measurement, not part of the tree — never in a fork sibling group). Within one batch, a deterministic no-knob-delta
step can give a child its parent's exact knob set (same `node_key`); duplicates collapse to one row (leaf's stats, max
— not sum — of their visits) so `record_nodes`'s SUM accumulation never double-counts a run. The store is
**group-holdout-fold ready** (`Dataset.fold_node_rows`, by `op_sig` / `gpu`): an op's -O1 tree, -O3 rows, and fail
leaves move to one side atomically and parent edges never cross a fold (`run_id` is provenance of the surviving
deduped value, deliberately NOT a fold axis). The prior still *trains* from the in-memory reservoir, but the `node`
store is *read back* by `eval prior
--dataset nodes` (`iter_nodes` → `diagnostics.node_report`): **per card**, it groups nodes by `parent_key` and prices the
**fork sibling regret** — what following the prior's per-fork pick costs, `value_us(predicted-best child) / value_us(true
best)` (1.00x = the prior steers into the best-reachable subtree; predicted-score ties price pessimistically, since greedy
breaks ties by emission order) — the search-faithful evaluation no leaf-only view can give. Each fork buckets by the knob
FAMILY its children decide (`TILE` / `REDUCE` / `STAGE` / …, from the child-vs-parent knob delta) — the stable notion of
tree level (raw `depth` is rule-step distance and renumbers as passes change) — rendered as a per-kernel × per-family
regret table with a per-family aggregate line. `node_report` drops
`bench_fail` rows up front (their `value_us` is the watchdog sentinel, not a measurement) and splits a card's block per
`H_opt` regime so -O1 and -O3 latencies never pool in leaf reachability. The per-card grouping matters
for a cross-hardware dataset: same-die SKUs (H100/H200) share an `S_*` op signature but not their latencies, so mixing
them would corrupt both metrics — the `gpu` key keeps their rows distinct.

The regret metric, and the **per-feature attribution views** behind `eval prior --dataset nodes --blame / --ablate`,
all consume one shared per-fork record (`diagnostics.fork_records`: siblings, featurized rows, scores, the
pessimistic pick, the measured best), so the three views agree on pick semantics by construction. They score through
the `Prior` **features seam** — `mean_score_features` / `mean_scores_features` take an already-featurized row
(contract: identical to `mean_score` on the raw knob dict), which is what lets the diagnostics mask individual `D_*`
features that have no knob-level spelling. **Blame** diffs `Prior.explain_features` (a signed per-term quality
decomposition; exact for the linear analytic prior, its hardcoded interactions included as `gate:*` pseudo-terms —
the terms sum to the scored quality, unit-tested) between the pick and the measured-best sibling, regret-weighted per
fork family; a missed fork no term separates is **BLIND** — a featurizer gap, not a weight problem. **Ablation Δ**
re-picks every fork with one feature masked (each model's own absent semantics: `0.0` term for the linear prior =
exact removal, `NaN` routing for CatBoost — flagged out-of-distribution until a dropout-trained model exists) and
reports the per-family median-regret change with the feature's fork support. Both are **diagnostic only, never gate
metrics**: attribution among correlated features is non-unique (masking any one of a redundant geometry block costs
the same Δ). Unlike the per-card regret/reachability tables, attribution POOLS cards and regimes — regret is a
within-fork ratio, so it compares safely.

Why CatBoost (chosen by `scripts/prior_bakeoff.py`): the model's greedy pick must not run off to a degenerate corner. A
linear model (the former `BayesianRidgePrior`) is monotone in every knob, so its optimum is always a corner of the
candidate box — the `BR=1` blow-up (4us → 232us / invalid kernels). Any **bounded** tree ensemble is off-manifold-safe
(an un-benched extreme inherits the nearest leaf's value), and among them CatBoost also generalizes to an *untuned* op
near-perfectly (leave-one-op-out pick ratio ~1.0 vs xgb/lgbm 1.18, rf 1.31). So one global CatBoost prior is good enough
on a new op that it is **not refit within an op's own search** — it is a fixed model per run. The dataset is bounded +
batched (`base.Prior`): each tuned op's value-of-position rows stream into a reservoir-sampled dataset capped at
`MAX_ROWS` (100k, Algorithm R across runs), and the model refits (`maybe_refit`) on a dataset-size-tiered cadence
(`REFIT_SCHEDULE` — frequently while data-poor, coarsening as it grows), then checkpoints. End-of-run does a
`maybe_refit(force=True)` so even a small tune ends with a fitted model. The checkpoint is a JSON file
(`config.prior_path()`, `~/.cache/emmy/prior.json`) holding the CatBoost `cbm` blob (base64) + the dataset; `tune`
writes it, `compile` / `run` read it.

**-O3 deployable samples.** The sweep compiles at `-Xcicc -O1` (fast, but a *ranking* signal — it ties configs that
differ at -O3, e.g. a `REDUCE` ILP fold or a warp tile's `WSPEC`). So whenever a bench lands **within `EMMY_O3_TOL`
(default 15%, `config.o3_tol`) of the best -O1 so far** — a band wider than a strict new best, so near-tied contenders all
qualify — the engine re-benches it at `-Xcicc -O3` (`_rebench_o3`) and `observe_o3` records an extra row with the same
realized knobs tagged `H_opt=3` (the deployable regime) — into the reservoir AND the `node` table, where it lands as a
parentless leaf row under its own -O3 `context_key` (see the node-store paragraph above). Each config is re-benched at
most once. The `H_*` feature lets
the -O1 (broad) and -O3 (near-best) rows coexist; `compile` / `run` run at -O3 (`H_opt=3`) so greedy ranks by the
deployable rows and reaches the true optimum. The `nvcc_flags` override rides the bench request to the worker, so only
winners pay the -O3 recompile and the cubin cache keys on the flags. All tune/bench timings are **CUDA-graph-captured** by
default (pure GPU time); each `perf` row records its mode in the `captured` column, and on write a captured measurement
supersedes a wall-semantics one for the same key (never the reverse), so old rows upgrade in place.

**Greedy uses the prior too — and flattens.** `greedy_decide` (the `Run.resolve` decide for `compile` / `run`) lazy-loads
the global `Prior` via `load_prior`. The lazy fork tree is an MCTS structure — it stages knob choices across levels
(`BR` → `BM/BN` → `FM/FN`) so MCTS pays one node per pop. Greedy must NOT walk it level-by-level: a branch carries only a
*partial* tile, and `features.knob_features` can't compute its area / occupancy until `FM/FN` are pinned, so the prior would
be blind at the `BM/BN` choice. Instead greedy **flattens** each fork point to its complete leaves
(`fork.flatten_leaves` expands branches depth-first; only knob dicts, materialization stays deferred to the chosen leaf)
and picks the lowest `Prior.mean_scores` over the full `{H_*, S_*, complete-knob-row}` vector in one batched `predict`,
invariant to the tree's level order. Cold the `AnalyticPrior` ranks (including a positive `MMA_tier` warp-preference);
only if `load_prior` returns nothing does it take option-0. Greedy benches nothing, so it can only *use* a prior, never
train one.

**Greedy validity fallback.** The prior ranks by predicted latency, which can rank a tile that fails `validate(ctx)`
(smem / thread budget) first — `tune` benches-and-skips it, but greedy benches nothing. So when a deterministic compile
leaves a node un-lowered, `Pipeline.run` blocklists that tile's `tile_identity` (its planner knobs) and **re-resolves**:
`greedy_decide(blocked=…)` drops the matching leaf and picks the next-best. Bounded by `_MAX_GREEDY_RETRIES`. When the
retry budget exhausts with the node still un-lowered (a *learned* prior can rank many over-budget tiles above the first
in-budget one), `Pipeline.run` takes one last **option-0 (emission-order) resolve** (`greedy_decide(prior=None)`): the
planner emits a budget-safe tile first, so it lowers whenever any in-budget tile exists. Only when even option-0 overflows
does `_raise_on_unlowered` fire the loud `LoweringError`.

**Driving the loop.** `emmy tune <model_or_ir | --code EXPR>` probes a `Context`, opens the tuning database
(`EMMY_TUNE_DB` or `~/.cache/emmy/autotune.db`), and calls `run_two_level_tune(...)`. The DB accumulates rows
across runs; re-running resumes from the cached state. On default verbosity (and a tty) a `TuneProgress` draws a live
single-line bar (completed/total tuned op leaves plus a `<kernel> <current us> (best <best us>) <knobs>` tail), threaded
as an optional `progress=` through `run_two_level_tune` (duck-typed, so the search package keeps no `commands/`
dependency); `-v` shows the per-`[tune]` INFO lines instead, `-q` is quiet. `--bench` re-benches the tuned winner at -O3
(deployable, not the -O1 ranking pass): the full model against the real torch module and each kernel via its `.torch.json`
provenance reproducer, vs eager / `torch.compile` / Emmy.

## Tunable knobs

A **`Knob`** (`knob.py`) is the canonical schema for one tuning dimension: name, type (`INT` / `BOOL` / `BINMASK` /
`STR`), candidate `hints` (advisory — the rule still validates structural fit), and a help string. Rules stamp values
into `TileOp.knobs` dicts; the autotuner reads those back as the per-hop knob delta in the `lowering` table. Every knob
is declared **in `search/space.py`** — the single home for the whole tunable surface — and imported by the rule
(`lowering/tile/_schedule`, the scheduling helper inside `010_recognize`) that resolves it. The registry
(`knob.registry()`) auto-collects every `Knob` instance in every loaded module — no manual registration. `knob.py` also
owns the `EMMY_<KNOB>` env namespace (decode per `Knob` type; `config.py` remains the sole owner of `os.environ`).

**Pinning knobs from the environment.** Two equivalent forms:

- **Per-knob:** `EMMY_<NAME>=<value>` (e.g. `EMMY_STAGE=d2/cp`). Read by the rule that owns the knob via
  `Knob.narrow`. The env-var key is built by `config.knob_var` and read via `config.knob_raw` / `config.int_env`.
- **Aggregate:** `EMMY_KNOBS="K1=V1,K2=V2,..."` (e.g. `EMMY_KNOBS="TILE=a:mma_m16n8k16_f16/w2x2/f2x2/k2,STAGE=d2/cp"`).
  Parsed once at `knob.py` import via `apply_knobs_env()`, which splats each entry into the corresponding
  `EMMY_<K>` var (`config.set_knob(..., overwrite=False)`). An explicit per-knob var wins over the aggregate.

Pinning replaces tuner choice (the rule emits exactly that variant instead of forking) and is **authoritative** — an env
value outside the knob's hint tuple is honored, not silently dropped (`Knob.narrow` returns `(pinned,)` regardless of
hint membership). Downstream structural gates (divisibility, threads-per-CTA budget, TMA eligibility) still apply, so a
structurally invalid pin yields an empty enumeration and the per-call-site fallback takes over. This lets a tile shape the
planner wouldn't reach on its own be explored manually.

A few pins are rejected outright (a clear `ValueError`) rather than silently degraded — they would otherwise lower to a
wrong or un-launchable kernel: a codec width must be `≥ 1` (a degenerate `b0` / `f0` / `n0` no longer parses to a
silently-dropped level); a warp `TILE` pin needs its **static** contraction K to be a multiple of the inner mma K-step
(`atom_k·bk`) since the warp K-loop has no static-K tail masking (a **symbolic** K is fine — it reaches the masked
zero-filled tier); a scalar `TILE` parallel block (`par_n·par_m`) is capped at the 1024-thread/CTA hardware limit; and a
`BOOL` knob rejects an unrecognized value instead of coercing a typo (`ture`) to `False`.

**Registered knobs** (all declared in `search/space.py`; see [`passes/ARCHITECTURE.md`](passes/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the
per-rule mechanics — the "owning rule" for the schedule codecs is the `_schedule` helper inside
`lowering/tile/010_recognize`, there is no separate `020_schedule` pass):

| Knob     | Type    | Owning rule                       | What it controls                                                        |
|----------|---------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `TILE`   | STR (codec) | `lowering/tile/010_recognize` (`_schedule`) | **Unified output-fragment** codec — a contraction's output tile is *either* the **scalar** register sub-tile `n<N>[x<M>]/f<fn>[x<fm>]` (parallel thread-tile `n`/`m`, register sub-tile `f`) *or* the **warp** tensor-core mma tile `a:<atom>/w<WM>x<WN>/f<FM>x<FN>/k<bk>` (atom + warps + register sub-tile + K-chunk), never both. The value self-discriminates: an `a:<atom>` token selects the warp form (a tensor-core-atom `TilePlan`; `schedule.is_warp_codec`), otherwise the scalar `TilePlan`. Empty = per-cell. A pin may spell the scalar tier explicitly as `a:scalar` (alias `a:none`) — the one `a:`-prefixed value that is *not* warp; pin-input vocabulary only, normalized back to the canonical scalar spelling (`""` / `n../f..`) so it never rides a stored knob (mirrors `PLACE`'s `auto`). |
| `REDUCE` | STR (codec) | `lowering/tile/010_recognize` (`_schedule`) | Reduce-axis partition codec `g<n>[a\|k]/b<n>/r<n>` — `g` cross-CTA split-K (+ finalize letter), `b` cooperative-thread fold, `r` ILP register fold. Empty = serial (the per-thread remainder is derived, never spelled). |
| `STAGE`  | STR (codec) | `lowering/tile/010_recognize` (`_schedule`) → `lowering/kernel/010_materialize` | Operand-staging codec `d<depth>/sync\|cp\|tma[/ring][/p<reg_depth>]` on the typed `Stage` schedule struct (composes with both fragments of the `TILE` knob): `d<depth>` the gmem→smem ring depth, `sync`/`cp.async`/TMA transport, `p<reg_depth>` the smem→register double-buffer. `stage=None` (unset / unparseable) = gmem-direct. Also rides the warp-flash TWISTED stream (`STAGE@<kv>` — the K/V slabs of one streaming block; cp.async only, `reg_depth` clamps to 1). See `lowering/kernel/ARCHITECTURE.md`. |
| `WSPEC`  | STR (codec) | `lowering/tile/010_recognize` (`_schedule`) → `lowering/kernel/010_materialize` | Warp-specialization codec `p<np>` — a producer warp band split over the fixed pipeline (bare/root-global; the fourth schedule-fork level). Legal on a warp `TILE` over a resolved **TMA** `STAGE` within the thread budget (`block_threads + 32·aux ≤ 1024`, `32·aux ≤ block_threads`); anything else — including the reserved producer `q` param — degrades to uniform. Empty = uniform SIMT. Materialized as the staged K-loop's producer/compute band split (`_stage._wspec_kloop`). |
| `PLACE`  | STR (pin-only) | `lowering/tile/010_recognize` | Structural placement of an intermediate edge — `auto` \| `fuse` \| `cut`, per edge-class element: `PLACE@cone` (producer-cone inlining), `PLACE@fold` (flash vs separate softmax + P@V kernels), `PLACE@tuple` (online softmax vs two-pass stats). Precedence `PLACE@<element>` > bare `PLACE` > built-in `auto` (today: fuse everywhere). `auto` is pin vocabulary only — the stamped value is the *resolved* `fuse`/`cut`, stamped for `fold`/`cone` only (`tuple` is dominance — never stamped, never enumerated). A forced `fuse` on an uncertifiable kernel (RoPE'd QK) degrades to `cut` with a log line. Since `@` is not a valid shell var character, per-element pins ride `EMMY_KNOBS` (e.g. `EMMY_KNOBS="PLACE@fold=cut"`); bare `EMMY_PLACE` pins every eligible edge. Never enumerated — the `auto` seam is the future search hook for `fold`/`cone`. |
| `S_*`    | FLOAT   | `loop/stamp/020_stamp_structural_features` | The LoopOp's structural features (stmt/op histogram + loop extents + operand dtypes). Not tunable — identity facts that make a knob dict a complete variant identity (the learned prior's feature vector). Skipped by `format_tuning_knobs`. |

The `REDUCE` codec's cross-CTA split is its `g<n>` field (GRID stage), and the **finalize** is that field's trailing
letter — `g<n>a` = in-place `atomicAdd` (one kernel, additive carriers only), `g<n>k` = deferred `__partial` workspace +
a sibling combine kernel (any carrier; the only legal arm for the twisted flash `(m, l, O)` split-KV). Pin via
`EMMY_REDUCE=g2k` (one flat knob — no per-axis `EMMY_REDUCE_<axis>`, no `EMMY_FINALIZE`). The split is
consumed by `lowering/tile/030_split` as a graph rewrite (partial + finalize); the letter round-trips through
`ReducePlan.parse`/`spell` and reads back as `ReducePlan.finalize`. The atomic finalize applies the kernel's projection
epilogue **per partition** before the `atomicAdd`, so it is only correct when that projection *distributes* over the add
(`Σ φ(xₛ) = φ(Σ xₛ)`): a constant scale like `mean`'s `×1/N` distributes and rides the atomic; a non-distributive
epilogue (`l2`'s `sqrt`, a fused bias/activation) is refused (`NotImplementedError` → pin `g<n>k`, which projects once
after the combine). The check is `030_split._projection_distributes`.

**Axis-named schedule keys.** A per-node schedule codec is stored keyed `FAMILY@<axis>` — `TILE@<k_axis>` /
`STAGE@<axis>` / `REDUCE@<axis>`, the reduce/contraction axis the node schedules — so a multi-node kernel (flash: `TILE@d`
QK + `TILE@sk` PV) can address each schedule-bearing node; `WSPEC` / `PLACE` stay root-global (bare). The **bare** form is
first-class: `resolve_axis(family, key, eligible)` maps a bare `TILE` to the unique eligible axis (a hand pin on a
two-node kernel raises naming the candidates; a family with no eligible axis drops). Readers go through
`family_value(knobs, family)` so a bare and a suffixed key parse / featurize / golden-match identically — the schema is
**invisible on one-node kernels** (the display collapses `TILE@d` / `REDUCE@d` back to bare when there is a single
eligible axis for the family, so those tables read as before and match the bare golden YAML). The schedule reduce
partition IS the axis-named reduce family — there is no separate native `REDUCE@` decision to collide with (the
reduce/split-K partition is the one reduce family), so `REDUCE` joins `TILE`/`STAGE` on the `@<axis>` keying. The op
cache key re-keys onto the axis-named identity (expected — the transfer handle for the prior, not a regression).

`BINMASK` parsing accepts a binary string (`"101"` = bits 0 and 2), the keywords `"all"` / `"none"`, or a decimal /
`0x`-hex int clamped to the candidate width. `format_tuning_knobs` drops `BOOL` knobs from the rendered `knobs=` line —
they're treated as pass-presence markers. `HOIST_COMPUTE` and `PAD_SMEM` are BOOL autotune forks emitted in a fixed order
(the greedy default first — inline-fuse / pad-on respectively); both honor their `EMMY_*` pin. The masked-K MMA slab
alignment pad is **not** a fork — it's stamped intrinsically on the `Source` at staging (a near-strict win greedy deploys
without a re-tune).

## Pass directories

Pass files are numerically prefixed so `sorted()` pickup is deterministic. Pick a fresh prefix when adding a rule; the
loader ignores the prefix itself — it's only for ordering readability. Per-pass authoring invariants are in
[`passes/ARCHITECTURE.md`](passes/ARCHITECTURE.md); the tile passes (`010_recognize` → `030_split`) and the
algebraic moveset are also documented there.

| Pass                      | What rules do                                                                                |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `frontend/decomposition/` | Rewrite frontend ops (`LinearOp`, `MatmulOp`, `SdpaOp`, layout ops, fused `rms_norm` / `layer_norm` / `softmax`) into tensor-IR primitives + layout-only `IndexMapOp`s, broadcast-explicit via `_broadcast.broadcast_to`. |
| `frontend/optimization/`  | `compose_indexmaps`: collapse chains of single-source / single-consumer `IndexMapOp` into one coord_map, so trivial layout kernels don't block fusion. |
| `loop/lifting/`           | `lift_*` rules wrap each surviving tensor primitive in a trivial one-op `LoopOp`.            |
| `loop/fusion/`            | `split_shared_indexmap` (first) fuses a fan-out pure-indexmap `LoopOp` into all its consumers in one rewrite; `merge_loop_ops` then splices adjacent single-consumer `LoopOp` pairs; `dedup_loads` drops identical `(input, index)` Loads. Folding scalar-constant broadcasts into consumers cuts Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B from 394 → 337 kernels. |
| `loop/recognize/`         | Empty (retired) — flash / online-softmax recognition moved into `lowering/tile/010_recognize` (the `_flash` / `_softmax` helpers), so the loop dialect carries no pattern recognizers. |
| `loop/stamp/`             | `stamp_loop_names` (`provenance.name_for`, e.g. `k_rms_norm_3f2a1b`) + `stamp_structural_features` (the `S_*` dict). Runs last in the loop dialect — after fusion and recognition — so every kernel is named / stamped against its final body. |
| `lowering/tile/`          | `LoopOp → TileOp` over the block-DAG Tile IR: `010_recognize` (recognition + inline scheduling via the `_schedule` helper — maps the grid, picks the reduce/output fragment, and **atomizes** — resolves the algebra→atom binding onto the schedule via `_atomize.py` when each option is built, rejecting an unbindable atom at fork construction) → `030_split`. Dispatch is on the carrier algebra (`MAP` / `SEMIRING` / `MONOID`), never a named shape. |
| `lowering/kernel/`        | `010_materialize` is a `TileOp → KernelOp` tier dispatcher (scalar / `_reduce`). A tiled `CONTRACTION` arrives as a high-level `Contraction` node already **built recognize-side** (`lowering/tile/_schedule._contraction_node` at fork-emit — one flat node splitting the algebra params (axes / operands / acc / epilogue) from the schedule (a `tile: TilePlan`); seam #1), so materialize only synthesizes its bare grid-`Write` and **expands** it through the one atom-generic `_factor.factorize` over the shared tiling layer (in `_factor.py`) (the geometry is derived on the `Contraction` node; `_atom.reduce_codegen` emits the shared K-loop and a swappable `store` sink, dispatched off the atom). Then the Kernel-IR peepholes: `030_stamp_types` (+ `040_demote_to_write_dtype`) resolve dtypes, `050_vectorize_loads` / `080_vectorize_stores` / `095_interleave_loads` pack/reorder memory ops, `110_drop_redundant_syncs`. See [`passes/lowering/kernel/ARCHITECTURE.md`](passes/lowering/kernel/ARCHITECTURE.md). |
| `lowering/cuda/`          | `lower_kernelop` renders the `KernelOp` body to a `__global__` source string (`ir/kernel/render.py::render_kernelop`) and mutates the node's op to `CudaOp` in place. |

## Dump hooks (`dump.py`)

`CompilerDump.on_pass(idx, pass_name, graph)` dumps the post-pass graph uniformly for every pass:
`NN_<pass_name>.{json,txt,dot}` (+ `NN_<pass_name>.kernels.txt` if any node has a non-empty `pretty_body()`). Slashes in
the pass name flatten to underscores. The pre-pipeline input graph is dumped separately as `00_input.*` via
`dump.dump_input_graph(graph)`. The uniform strategy means adding a pass automatically gets dumped — no registration.

Per compute kernel, `_dump_per_kernel` writes `<prefix>.kernels/<kname>.json` — a standalone sub-graph (kernel + its
`InputOp` / `ConstantOp` producers) loadable via `emmy run --ir`. When op provenance is present (see
`compiler/provenance.py`), it also writes `<kname>.torch.json` + `.torch.txt`: the **original Torch ops** that kernel
implements, sliced from the pristine pre-decomposition graph by origin id (so the slice is always whole Torch ops), with
an `i/N` coverage header — runnable via `emmy run --ir <kname>.torch.json --bench` to reproduce accuracy / latency
vs torch.

## Per-rule diff output (`rule_diff.py`)

At `compile -vv` (DEBUG) the engine emits one block per rule application: a unified diff between the matched subgraph and
the rewritten fragment, bracketed by `>>> <pass>:NNN_rulename` and `<<< <pass>:NNN_rulename` markers. The `<pass>` prefix
is the single-letter shorthand from `PASS_SHORTHAND` (`d` / `o` / `l` / `f` / `t` / `k` / `c`) — the same letters the CLI
accepts in `--passes dolft` (`commands/compile.py` imports `PASS_SHORTHAND` so the flag and the marker prefix can't
drift). Skipped rules collapse to a one-liner. The bracketing makes per-rule / per-pass slicing trivial via `awk`; ANSI
color is applied only inside the diff body so the markers stay plain ASCII. Color follows `compile --color`. Body-carrying
ops render through their own `pretty_body` (the in-flight `TileGraphOp` pretty-prints its block-DAG), so a tile-pass diff
reads as a readable block-DAG delta. The structured `.rules.json` dump is unaffected — the diff is purely presentation.

## Fragment splice (`engine._apply_replacement`)

1. Walk the fragment in topo order. `InputOp` nodes forward their id to the existing graph node (external reference);
   non-Input nodes are added with fresh ids.
2. `replace_node(match.output or match.root_node_id, new_output)` rewires all consumers (and `graph.outputs` slots) from
   the old output to the fragment's output id.
3. Merge hints from every consumed node into the new output.
4. Remove consumed nodes and run `_remove_orphans` to drop any now-dangling constants / inputs.

## Invariants

- A rule module must not reach into the engine's internals; its interface is `PATTERN` + `rewrite(graph, match)`.
- `pipeline/` imports from `ir/` but never from `backend/`. Lowering rules produce IR; executing that IR is the
  backend's job.
