"""Fork interface + implementations: the deferred fork options the search
engine ranks and resolves, and the hierarchical Fork-tree builder shared by
pipeline rules that enumerate a knob cartesian.

:class:`Fork` is the interface — ``knobs``, ``is_leaf``, ``expand()``.
Implementations hold their producer's state as data:
:class:`OptionFork` (a concrete ``Op``/``Graph`` leaf) and the tree node
classes :class:`_Branch` / :class:`_Leaf` built by :func:`build_fork_tree`.

The tree builder converts a flat list of variant knob rows (plain dicts)
into the ROOT :class:`_Branch` of a lazy tree: each ``Level`` groups
siblings by a (sub)tuple of knob values and collapses levels whose key has
a single distinct value across the group (rows with an empty key skip the
level). Below the last level every row becomes one :class:`_Leaf` carrying
its COMPLETE row as ``knobs`` — the row IS the variant identity (the
``S_*`` structural-feature knobs ride the merged dict), so the perf DB and
the learned prior key leaves and branches by knobs alone, no structural
probing. ``expand()`` yields ``materialize(row)`` once the search engine
resolves a leaf.
Everything is lazy: no Fork below the root exists until the search expands
it. Siblings are emitted in grouping order — RANKING IS SEARCH POLICY: the
policies rank the frontier with the learned prior (Forks carry no score).

The engine in ``pipeline.py`` consumes ``fork.knobs`` flat (it doesn't walk
ancestors): branch Forks pin their level's slice of the row, leaves carry
the whole row.

    """Interface for a deferred fork option in the search tree.

    Two flavors share the interface:

    - **Branch Fork** (``is_leaf=False``) — produced explicitly by a rule's
      ``rewrite()`` to spawn a hierarchical fork point. ``expand()`` returns
      the next level of options (more Forks, concrete leaves, or a mix);
      the search loop drives this via :meth:`LazyCandidate.expand`.
    - **Leaf Fork** (``is_leaf=True``) — wraps one concrete ``Op`` /
      ``Graph`` rewrite. ``expand()`` returns ``[option]`` (one element);
      :meth:`LazyCandidate.resolve` invokes it once at resolve time to
      retrieve the leaf and apply it.

    Sharing one interface lets ``LazyCandidate.pending`` carry just
    ``Fork`` (no tagged union) — the search loop branches on
    ``Fork.is_leaf`` to decide expand-vs-resolve.

    ``knobs`` is the knob-delta this Fork pins (the variant identity the
    perf DB and the learned prior key on, read without expanding). Ranking
    is SEARCH policy: the engine hands unranked siblings to ``Search.push``
    and the policy ranks them with the learned
    :class:`~emmy.compiler.pipeline.search.prior.Prior` (greedy
    ``mean_score`` argmin; MCTS PUCT). Forks carry no score of their own —
    the analytic per-fork scorer was removed when the learned prior replaced
    it; siblings are emitted in grouping order and the cold/no-prior fallback
    is that emission order."""
