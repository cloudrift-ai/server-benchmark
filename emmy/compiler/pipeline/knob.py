"""Knob descriptor — the canonical schema for a tunable / forkable rule parameter.

Each ``Knob`` declares one tuning dimension: its name (also the env-var
key), its type (driving parse + pretty), the autotune candidate hints,
and a short help string. Rules emit knob values into ``TileOp.knobs``
dicts; the env layer reads ``EMMY_<NAME>`` to pin a knob across
the whole run; pretty-printing routes through the descriptor so
display matches storage.

This module owns the ``Knob`` *descriptor* (the dataclass), the
registry, and the env plumbing — **not** the concrete knob
declarations (those live in :mod:`emmy.compiler.pipeline.search.space`,
beside the enumeration value grids) and **not** the featurizers (those
live in :mod:`emmy.compiler.pipeline.search.features`). INVARIANT:
every ``Knob`` *instance* is declared in ``search/space.py``, and rules
import the knobs they decide from there. The :func:`registry`
introspects every loaded module under ``emmy/`` and collects every
``Knob`` instance — no ``register(...)`` wrapper, no manual bookkeeping
— so a knob declared in ``space.py`` is discovered as soon as a rule
imports it (all rules load at pipeline startup).
