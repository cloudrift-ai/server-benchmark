"""Shared helper for the ``004a`` / ``004b`` constant-fold rules.

Both rules absorb a single layout op (``TransposeOp`` / ``ReshapeOp``)
whose only input is a parameter ``ConstantOp`` into the constant's
``load_ops`` chain. The rewrite is uniform; the rule files differ only
in their ``PATTERN`` op type, so the body lives here.

Gated on sm_90+ (the TMA path). Folding under the default cp.async path
changes shapes in ways other passes (RoPE, SDPA, register-tile) don't
expect — the consumer Load index already matches the smem layout via
``120_transpose`` / ``130_reshape``'s IndexMap fusion. Folding under
the TMA path is what enables LDS.128 vectorization on the asymmetric
``(BN, BM)`` tile shape (see ``tuning.py``). The gate is a behavior
preservation choice; the ``load_ops`` field itself is general-purpose
and is honored by the loader regardless of how a chain got recorded.
