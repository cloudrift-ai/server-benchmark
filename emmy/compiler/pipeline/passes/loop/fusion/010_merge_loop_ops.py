"""Merge adjacent ``LoopOp``s via graph splicing.

Every match is represented as a producer-to-sink region: one consumer is
the degenerate two-node case, while a fan-out uses its nearest owned
reconvergence. The complete region goes to the N-way splicer. Shared
internal definitions remain SSA and are emitted once per equal
scope/coordinate demand; no frontend treeification is needed. The splicer also
handles multiple consumer loads and shared external inputs uniformly
(first-seen slot assignment + splice-edge routing).

The only materialization-policy guard is aggregate compute growth:
``_total_work`` sums the enclosing free×reduce iteration count of every compute
leaf, and a merge is refused when that grows by more than
``_BLOWUP_FACTOR``. Structural region ownership, a real splicer rejection,
and the fence around an already-realized ``__cut_`` workspace remain
invariants rather than candidate-selection gates.

The factor was picked empirically by sweeping 2…1024 on a TinyLlama block at
sequence length 32. Values 2–16 tied at roughly 4.18 ms / 18 launches; 32–512
shifted to roughly 4.7 ms / 17 launches; 1024 unlocked an approximately 1000×
up-projection-to-down-projection nesting and took 433 ms. Eight is the middle
of the best plateau while retaining useful epilogue fusion.
