"""Greedily fuse maximal downstream ``LoopOp`` regions to a fixed point.

Separate consumers become output ports of one kernel. All roots enter the
same worklist, so shared upstream statements remain one SSA definition.

Fusion has only correctness boundaries and the fence around an already-realized
``__cut_`` workspace. Recognition and scheduling never gate fusion.
