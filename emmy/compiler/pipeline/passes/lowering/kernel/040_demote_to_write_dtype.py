"""Demote elementwise Assigns to a narrower dtype when their result
flows to a narrower-dtype Write (or to another demoted Assign).

Pattern the pass closes (from softmax over fp16):

    __half acc_b = ...;
    float acc1_b = ...;
    float v2 = 1.0f / acc1_b;
    __half in2 = x_smem[a];
    __half v3 = in2 - acc_b;
    __half v4 = hexp(v3);
    float v5 = v2 * __half2float(v4);    // <-- f32 compute
    out[a] = __float2half(v5);           // <-- demoted at store

After demotion of ``v5`` to f16, the multiply uses native fp16 and the
store happens without a final conversion:

    __half v5 = __float2half(v2) * v4;
    out[a] = v5;

In the user's words: the pass detects ``half → float → ... → float →
half`` sequences and demotes the float-compute middle to half.

## Algorithm

Backward dataflow over the KernelOp body:

1. Build a def map ``name → defining_stmt`` from a deep ``Body.iter()``.
2. Seed a worklist with the ``value`` of every ``Write`` whose output
   buffer is fp16.
3. For each seeded name, if it's defined by an ``Assign`` whose op has
   a native fp16 form, mark that Assign demoted. Recurse to the
   Assign's args: any arg defined by another native-fp16-form Assign
   that we haven't visited becomes a candidate. Args defined by
   ``Load`` / ``Accum`` / non-native-fp16 ``Assign`` are stopping
   points — the renderer inserts the conversion at the consumer's use
   site via ``ctx.target.convert``.
4. Walk the body via ``Body.map`` and stamp ``Assign.dtype = F16`` on
   every Assign in the demote set.

## Why this is safe

- ``Accum`` is not crossed — its dtype is the freeze point chosen by the
  reduction's seed; changing it would change reduction semantics.
- ``Load`` is not crossed either — the source buffer's dtype is the
  ground truth; Load.render already declares the local in that dtype.
- Ops without a native fp16 form aren't demoted; they stay in fp32
  via the existing promote-and-demote path in ``Assign.render``.
- The demoted Assign's mixed-dtype args (e.g. one f32 reciprocal feeding
  a f16 multiply) are handled by ``_args_at_dtype`` in the renderer:
  each f32 arg gets a per-use ``__float2half`` wrap.

## When the pass doesn't fire

- Output is fp32 → no fp16-demanding Writes.
- The chain feeding the Write contains an op without a native fp16
  form, AND that op is the immediate predecessor of the Write — the
  pass demotes nothing in that case (raising ``RuleSkipped``).
- The body is already demoted (idempotent — the pass skips Assigns
  with ``self.dtype is not None``).
