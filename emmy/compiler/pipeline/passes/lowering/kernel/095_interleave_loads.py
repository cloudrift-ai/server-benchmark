"""Sink Loads in flat compute blocks to just before their first consumer.

When a register-tile matmul body emits its cells as a flat sequence (all
Loads hoisted to the top, then the FMAs), ptxas has to schedule loads/FMAs
across the whole cluster. The article SGEMM hand-emits each A-load right
before its consumer FMAs, which lets ptxas place the LDS adjacent to its
consumer without rescheduling across the block.

This pass approximates that pattern via a peephole "sink each Load to just
before its first consumer" reorder on every body that holds a Load + Assign
cluster. ``Stmt.defines`` / ``Stmt.deps`` carry the SSA dependency
information; we walk forward, identify each Load's first consumer position,
and re-emit:

- Loads with NO consumer in the body stay at the top in original order
  (they're consumed in a sibling / outer scope; sinking them would cross
  the body boundary).
- Loads with consumers in the body get placed immediately before their
  first consumer.
- Non-Load stmts keep their relative order — no semantic reorder of
  Assigns / Accums.

Observed impact: an IR-legibility transform; ptxas reschedules both forms to
nearly the same SASS at deployable opt levels, so ``INTERLEAVE_LOADS`` is
*not* a search dimension — only ``True`` is enumerated.
``EMMY_INTERLEAVE_LOADS=0`` remains a manual override.

Idempotent — a body already in interleaved form is a no-op.
