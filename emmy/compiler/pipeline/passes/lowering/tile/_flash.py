"""Flash-attention helper — recognition and construction.

The ``010_recognize`` pass calls :func:`try_flash`; everything flash lives here. Two
halves:

- **Recognition** — :func:`try_flash` matches a softmax-then-P@V kernel (+ its clean
  scaled-QK producer) via ``_recognize`` / ``_extract_qk`` / ``_classify_rowmax``, and
  emits the fused fragment.
- **Construction** — the ``flash_combine`` carrier, the ``flash_shape_eligible`` /
  ``gqa_group`` predicates, and the fragment builder ``build_flash_frag``. It doesn't
  hand-assemble a kernel body — it builds the high-level **structural-node tree**
  (``ir/tile/ir``): flash is the **two-``Contraction`` tree** ``Map(body=[O/l projection],
  source=Reduction(role=TWISTED, axis=kv, partial=[Contraction(Σ_dd Q·K), …, Contraction(Σ_j P·V)]))``
  — the ``(m,l,O)`` LSE streaming reduce over kv whose per-step ``partial`` holds BOTH the ``Σ_dd Q·K``
  score :class:`Contraction` (at its head) and the **P@V** ``Σ_j P·V`` :class:`Contraction` (its A
  operand the register-resident softmax weight ``P``; ``_split_pv`` redirects the carrier's
  expectation-fold value through it), projected ``O/l`` after the loop. Both Q@K and P@V ride the
  single walked ``partial`` edge (no ``source`` asymmetry) and factorize through the one
  ``_factor`` contraction path; block=1 is the scalar streaming degenerate (``j`` a singleton reduce).
  ``build_flash_frag`` returns that ``Map`` UNLOWERED, on a ``TileOp`` with an UNMAPPED ``Placement``
  — the free ``(batch…, m, d)`` axes are the schedule's (like every recognizer), and ``_schedule``
  maps them onto the grid; ``materialize`` lowers the nodes (``Reduction.loop`` splices the
  contraction's ``Σ Q·K`` loop ahead of the partial, the scalar tier expanding the same loop nest) +
  generates the output-store glue (the ``Write`` at the grid cell — not stored).

  A tensor-core flash tier is **not** a bespoke emitter: the mandate is that giving the Q@K / P@V
  contractions an mma ``TilePlan`` (a schedule field on the node) must route through the same
  ``_factor`` contraction path as any other mma matmul. Until that lands the whole way through the one
  emitter, flash lowers **only** on the scalar tier below — there is no divergent flash codegen path.

``is_flash_score_producer`` lets ``010_recognize`` defer the general lift of a scaled-QK
score producer until its softmax-then-P@V consumer has fused (the fusion reads the
producer's Q/K as plain ``Load``\\ s, so it must stay a ``LoopOp`` until then).

(Online softmax — flash's softmax-stats half without the P@V — lives in ``_softmax``.)

Scope is the **clean** scaled-QK producer (Q/K recoverable as plain ``Load``\\ s). A
fused score producer whose Q/K are computed SSA — RoPE'd QK — is NOT recognized as
flash (it falls back to its un-fused tiers); a producer-splicing builder for that case
was removed rather than kept half-converted to the op tree.

The fragment fuses scaled-dot-product attention into ONE kernel that tiles the KV
(reduce) axis and never materializes the ``[S_q, S_k]`` score matrix. The scalar tier
runs one independent streaming softmax per output element ``(…, m, d)`` — a correct, if
redundant, form::

    for *batch, m (query rows), d (value dim):       # free / grid
      Init (m_i = -inf, l_i = 0, O_i = 0)            # running (max, denom, out)
      for kv in 0..S_k:                              # streaming reduce (TWISTED)
        Init sacc = 0
        for dd in 0..head_dim: sacc += Q[…,m,dd]·K[…,kv,dd]   # Q@K score Contraction
        s = sacc · scale
        M = max(m_i, s); alpha = exp(m_i − M); P = exp(s − M)  # softmax stats (flash_combine merge)
        l_i = l_i·alpha + P
        for j in 0..1:  O_i__pv += P · V[…,kv,d]     # P@V Contraction (block=1: singleton j)
        O_i = O_i·alpha + O_i__pv                    # the LSE rescale + PV fold
      out[…,m,d] = O_i / l_i

Scope: static OR dynamic (symbolic ``seq_len`` on Q/K/V dim -2 — one cached kernel
carrying ``int seq_len`` serves every runtime size, the symbol landing on BOTH the
masked-row M and the symbolic reduce), causal or non-causal (causal masks the
score per element, ``kv ≤ m`` else −inf — tile-skip is a tensor-core-tier
follow-up), an optional broadcast additive mask (the HF ``(1,1,S,S)`` float bias),
and GQA (``q_heads == group · kv_heads``; the K/V head axis read at ``head //
group`` directly, no materialized broadcast). Fusion is the ``PLACE@fold`` placement
(default ``fuse``; ``cut`` is the multi-kernel attention escape — gated in
``010_recognize``, before :func:`try_flash` is even tried); the two-level ``OptionFork``
offer + ``AnalyticPrior`` cold-start are a follow-up.
