"""Pipeline value types and compile driver: ``Pattern``, ``Match``,
``Rule``, ``RuleSkipped``, ``Pass``, ``Cursor``, ``Pipeline``, ``Run``.

Bundled together because they form a tight chain — ``Pattern`` defines
what a rule matches, ``Rule`` carries the pattern + rewrite, ``Pass``
groups rules, ``Pipeline`` is the frozen pass layout + matcher, ``Run``
owns ONE drive of that layout (ctx / search / db / backend / dump /
rejections + the engine loop), ``Cursor`` tracks per-candidate resume
state inside a Run, and ``Match`` carries ``Rule`` (which backref-resolves
to ``Pass``). ``Run`` exposes two entry points over one shared rule-batch
body (``Run._step``): ``drive`` (exploration — a ``Search`` policy ranks
the fork frontier) and ``resolve`` (deterministic resolution — a
``decide`` callback picks at each ``ForkPoint`` and the fold returns the
terminal graph plus a ``Decision`` trace).

``Pipeline`` also owns the compile entry points — :meth:`build`,
:meth:`run`, :meth:`tune` (each constructs a :class:`Run` and drives it).
The per-rule logging, rewrite-kwarg dispatch, and snapshot rendering live
on :class:`Candidate` (see :mod:`..search.candidate`).

          blocklist its tile and re-resolve, falling back to the next
          prior-ranked leaf. Bounded retries (each adds ≥1 block or
          stops).
        * **Structural retirement** — a resolution that took a
          *structural* pick (a prior-priced kernel-set change; the trace
          contains a ``Graph`` decision) gets one coarser fallback
          first: any lowering failure retires structural picks wholesale
