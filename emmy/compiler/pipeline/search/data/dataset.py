"""``Dataset`` — a queryable read-view over a bag of :class:`Sample`s, with one
adapter per measurement-data source (golden / tune-DB / online-prior reservoir)
and the two grouping axes the consumers need.

The two groupings are deliberately distinct and do **not** collapse:

- :meth:`group_by_op` keys on the full ``S_*`` structural signature — two different
  shapes are different groups. This is what the prior diagnostics
  (reachability / calibration / coverage) need.
- :meth:`group_by_kernel_name` keys on the kernel C identifier (parsed from
  ``cuda_op.pretty``) — which *merges* shapes of the same kernel, by design, so the
  per-knob regret analysis measures relative knob impact across shapes.

        - ``"op"`` — key on ``op_sig``: leave-one-op-out. An op's -O1 tree, its

        - ``"gpu"`` — key on ``gpu``: leave-one-GPU-out (cross-hardware transfer).
