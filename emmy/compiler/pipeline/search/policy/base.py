"""``Search`` ABC shared by the concrete policies.

The engine ↔ policy protocol is TOKEN-THREADED: every ``pop`` hands back
an opaque token alongside the candidate, and the engine passes that token
back explicitly — ``push(parent=token)`` to attribute spawned children to
their fork point, ``observe(token, ...)`` to attribute a terminal's
measurement. Lineage never depends on call order (no "most recently
popped" hidden state), so the policy's bookkeeping stays correct even if
the engine interleaves pops, pushes, and observes.

- ``pop`` returns ``(token, candidate)`` (``None`` ends the run);
- ``push`` enqueues spawned candidates (unranked fork siblings) under
  ``parent`` — the token of the pop that produced them, or ``None`` for
  the seed candidate that starts a run; the policy ranks the frontier with
  the learned prior (Forks carry no score);
- ``observe`` is called by :meth:`Pipeline.tune` once per yielded
  terminal, with the terminal's token and the aggregated ``reward``
  (``1/total_us``) + ``status`` from the bench. Default is a no-op;
  :class:`TuningSearch` overrides it to backprop on its MCTS tree.

Tokens are minted by the policy and opaque to the engine:
:class:`TuningSearch` (the only policy) uses its ``SearchNode`` as the token.
