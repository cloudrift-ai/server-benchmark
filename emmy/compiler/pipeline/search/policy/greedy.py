"""The greedy compile pick — :func:`greedy_decide`, a ``Run.resolve`` decide
factory picking each fork point's globally-best **complete** leaf via the
global learned prior when one is trained, else option-0.

This is the deterministic pick for ``compile`` / ``run``, the structural
pricing probes, and the assembled-graph lowering. It is NOT a search and not
a ``Search`` policy: there is no frontier to rank, no tree, no benching — a
deterministic resolution is a fold over the pipeline (at each fork, a pure
function of ``(options, op, prior)``, argmin, continue), so its process state
is :meth:`Run.resolve`'s returned trace, never accumulated policy attributes.
It can only *use* a prior trained earlier by ``tune``, never train one.
Exploration stays in :class:`~.mcts.TuningSearch` (``Pipeline.tune``).

**Flatten, don't descend.** The lazy fork tree (``lowering/tile`` planner) is an
MCTS data structure — it stages knob choices across levels (``BR`` → ``BM/BN`` →
``FM/FN``) so MCTS pays one node per pop. Greedy must NOT walk it level-by-level:
a branch carries only a *partial* tile, and ``features.knob_features`` can't compute
the tile's area / occupancy until ``FM/FN`` are pinned — so the prior is blind at
the ``BM/BN`` choice and defaults to ``BN=16`` for every shape. Instead greedy
**flattens** each fork point to its complete leaves
(:func:`~emmy.compiler.pipeline.fork.flatten_leaves` — cheap, ``expand``
builds only knob dicts; materialization stays deferred to the one chosen leaf)
and picks the one with the lowest :meth:`Prior.mean_scores` over the
full feature vector the prior trained on: the ``H_*`` host/hardware regime + the
op's ``S_*`` structural knobs (read off the offer op) + the leaf's complete knob
row. The pick equals scoring the flat candidate set, invariant to the tree's
level order. With no trained prior the model is unfit → it falls back to the first
emitted sibling (option-0).
