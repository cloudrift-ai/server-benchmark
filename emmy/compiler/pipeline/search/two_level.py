"""Two-level autotuning: an outer fusion MCTS whose terminal reward comes from
an inner, separable, per-op search.

``emmy tune`` used to run one SP-MCTS tree over the whole graph. Because
the pipeline applies rules sequentially, op-variant forks (tile / pad / stage
choices for one kernel) and fusion forks (how ops group into kernels) **nest**
and cross-product under one global patience — so the bottleneck op starves the
deep ops (see ``project_mcts_exploration_limit``). The two kinds of decision
have opposite structure:

- **op-variant forks are separable** — every multi-option fork today is an
  in-place ``Op`` rebind that leaves the graph unchanged, so the whole-graph
  time is ``Σ_k t_k`` with each ``t_k`` depending only on op ``k``'s variant;
- **fusion forks are NOT separable** — they change *which ops exist*.

So we split the search in two, drawing the boundary on the fork's *effect*
(the ``Op``-rebind / ``Graph``-splice classification stamped at the engine's
spawn site), not on a fixed
pass index:

- **Outer** (:func:`run_two_level_tune`) drives the graph-changing passes —
  ``frontend`` + ``loop`` plus the pre-partition head of ``lowering/tile``
  (:func:`outer_pipeline`), where the structural fork emitters live (today
  ``010_split_demoted``'s keep-vs-split offer). A terminal is the state where
  the cursor reaches ``partition_loops`` with every structural fork resolved —
  every op post-fusion and structurally final, split producers/consumers
  included as real ``LoopOp`` nodes. Each terminal is a candidate fused graph;
  its reward is ``1 / Σ best-per-op time`` from the inner search,
  backpropagated by the reused :class:`TuningSearch` — so keep-vs-split is an
  outer-terminal comparison, the natural cost model for a kernel-set decision.
  Identical offer sites within a trajectory take the same side — the engine
  replays the decision read off the trajectory's own graph via the
  ``Op.source`` decomposition links and the stamped decision knobs
  (``pipeline._replay_structural_decision``) — keeping the tree linear in
  *unique* kernels. Fusion itself is still
  deterministic (no multi-option fusion forks); this remains the clean
  insertion point for fusion search when those forks exist.
- **Inner** (:func:`_inner_reward_async`) tunes each finalized kernel *independently*
  in its own single-node slice (:func:`single_node_graph`) with a plain
  :class:`TuningSearch` over :data:`LOWERING_PASSES` only. Results key
  structurally (:func:`op_cache_key`), so they transfer to the assembled graph
  unchanged AND are shared across outer terminals (a shared op is a DB hit).

The inner search runs for **every** op on every pass — it is never skipped on
prior effort. Replay is cheap, not gated: each benched terminal hits the
per-variant ``perf`` cache (:class:`pipeline._TerminalBench`), so a variant
already measured is served from the DB with no GPU bench. An identical re-run
(same prior) re-walks the same deterministic trajectory → every terminal is a
cache hit → zero benches and the same total. But the global learned prior keeps
changing (it refits across ops and runs), so the same patience can steer the
MCTS down a *different* trajectory — re-running lets it reach and bench the
genuinely-new variants the improved prior surfaces, replaying the rest for free.
(The old per-op ``op_effort`` "skip already-tuned" gate is gone: it skipped the
whole op, which would suppress exactly that prior-driven re-exploration.)

    :func:`_inner_reward_async`, then greedy-assemble the DB-best kernels and bench
    the whole graph once for the separability check.

    ``backends`` (a list of device-pinned :class:`CudaBackend`s) fans the inner
    per-kernel search out across GPUs; the default single ``backend`` is the
    one-slot serial pool.

    The outer drives a :class:`Run` directly (manual ``observe``)
    because its terminal reward comes from the inner tuning, not
    ``_bench_terminal_async``. The outer pipeline (:func:`outer_pipeline`) runs
    through the pre-partition tile rules, so each structural fork (the
    keep-vs-split offer of ``010_split_demoted``) branches the outer tree —
    one terminal per kernel-set, compared by Σ-per-op cost. A graph with no
    structural offers yields a single terminal and this reduces to "tune each
    op once, sum, assemble". Identical offer sites within one trajectory
    replay the first decision (read off the graph —
    ``pipeline._replay_structural_decision``), and a terminal whose kernels
    are all known is a pure DB read, so extra terminals stay cheap."""
