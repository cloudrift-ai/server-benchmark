"""Op provenance — map fused kernels back to the original frontend (PyTorch) ops.

A node carries one hint, ``prov`` (key :data:`PROV`), a JSON-safe map::

    {origin_id: {"kind": <op-class-name>, "pieces": [piece_id, ...]}}

``origin_id`` is the trace-time node id of an original frontend op (e.g.
``rms_norm_0``); ``pieces`` are the node ids of the primitives that op
decomposed into and that this node embodies. The piece set grows as
decomposition expands an op into many primitives (mint, :func:`mint`) and as
fusion merges primitives from one origin into a single kernel (aggregate,
:func:`union`). A kernel's coverage of an origin is ``len(its pieces)`` over the
union of that origin's pieces across the whole graph (:func:`totals` /
:func:`coverage`) — so ``i/N`` stays correct under CSE and recursive
decomposition instead of freezing ``N`` at the first split.

Pure attribution metadata: it rides on ``Node.hints``, which structural and
autotune-cache keys already skip, so it never affects codegen identity. Stored
with ``list`` (never ``set``) piece collections so it round-trips through
``Graph.to_dict`` / JSON unchanged.
