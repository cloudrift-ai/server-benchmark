"""Structural identity protocol — one convention for every type whose
instances we want to compare or dedup by their structure rather than by
Python identity / field equality.

Implementers return a hex sha256 digest folded over the bits of state
that affect downstream behavior (codegen output, dataflow semantics,
compilation result). Bits that are name-only / advisory / ambient I/O
are deliberately excluded — see each implementer's docstring for the
exact include/exclude list.

Implementers today:

- :class:`emmy.compiler.graph.Graph` — Merkle digest over op kinds,
  body structure, output shapes/dtypes, input wiring; excludes node ids,
  Tensor names, and Hints.
- :class:`emmy.compiler.ir.stmt.body.Body` — canonicalized body
  rendering with SSA / axis / commutative-arg / external-buffer names
  normalized away.
- :class:`emmy.compiler.ir.tile.ir.Fold` /
  :class:`emmy.compiler.ir.tile.ir.TileOp` — the tile term's α-invariant
  identity, digested bottom-up from per-node canonical content plus the
  children's cached keys (``ir/tile/_key.py``); excludes placement,
  schedule slices, workers and stores.
- :class:`emmy.compiler.context.Context` — codegen-affecting
  compilation knobs (compute capability today; tuning overrides as they
  land). Excludes ambient I/O fields (dump dirs, verbosity, the session
  cache).

``Op.cache_key`` layers on these: each kernel-bearing dialect folds its
content identity with the op's knob dict for the tuning / cubin caches.

The cache layer in the autotuning loop keys candidates by these digests,
so adding a field to an implementer is an explicit decision: include it
in the digest only if it changes generated code or dataflow semantics.

``digest(*parts)`` is the canonical fold helper — pass a mix of strings,
ints, bytes, and pre-computed child digests; the helper canonicalizes
via ``repr`` and returns a hex sha256 string. Composite implementers use
it to fold child digests with their own discriminating fields.
