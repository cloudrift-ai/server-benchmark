# Golden-bench kernel attempt on H200

## Conclusion

The latest non-dry invocation failed before tracing, tuning, or kernel benchmarking began. It produced no latency,
correctness, or coverage measurements and supports no kernel-performance claim. The failure is retained because
dry-run validation is not a result.

## Protocol and failure

The invocation selected one `common` row on a pre-allocated host detected as eight NVIDIA H200 141GB GPUs. The task
used one GPU and targeted `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B@c1899de289a04d12100db370d81485cdf75e47ca`, layer 0, sequence length 512,
with search budget 12, patience 4, and seed 0.

Remote setup reached the command after staging a clean source tree. The command then failed because `make` was not
installed. Its exit trap encountered a second error because `task_dir` was unset, so the intended `artifacts.tar.gz`
was never created or retrieved. The command result records exit code 1 and the missing-result transfer error. The
runner summary is 0/1 successful tasks.

## System and provenance

- Hardware detected: NVIDIA H200 141GB x8; the task requested one GPU.
- Timestamp: `2026-08-13_16-08-20_e1c8d16a`.
- Git revision: `030b6d58182bb3da1748c4954d7d2fd0211e8d3b`; staged source was clean.
- Workload status: failed before measurement.
- The legacy command result has no assembled experiment record and no complete typed system-information section.
