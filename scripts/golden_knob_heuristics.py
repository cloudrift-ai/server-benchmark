"""Offline fit of the :class:`AnalyticPrior` weights (``_W_A``) over ``knob_features``.

Motivation
----------
The two-level autotuner explores the post-fusion kernel's knob space with an inner
MCTS that stops on **patience** (N consecutive measured terminals with no new
best). Cold (no learned data) that search is ranked by the :class:`AnalyticPrior` —
a fixed linear model over the engineered ``D_*`` geometry / occupancy features
:func:`features.knob_features` produces. If the golden config sits at rank 800 of 2400,
patience never reaches it. This script fits the linear weights so the golden lands
near the top.

It treats the problem as offline learning-to-rank, over the SINGLE featurization
(``features.knob_features`` — no parallel feature set), covering **every kernel
regime**: fp32-scalar + fp16/bf16-warp matmul, cooperative reduce, and pointwise.

  1. For every golden (matmul thread / warp / dyn, reduce, pointwise), reconstruct
     the planner's exact candidate enumeration for that mode and locate the golden
     row. Matmul goldens reuse ``analytic._enumerate`` — the SAME gate-narrowed pool
     ``eval analytic`` and the greedy deploy rank over (fp32 → thread tier, fp16/bf16
     → the warp tier alone; the block-DAG rework moved the scalar↔warp choice to a
     structural fork, so a warp golden ranks within the warp tier, not against
     scalar rows). Reduce / pointwise trace the snippet and capture the restored
     schedule fork's rows through the same live-fork capture
     (``analytic.enumerate_graph``).
  2. Featurize every candidate via ``features.knob_features`` (the ``D_*`` engineered
     features plus ``MMA_tier``, the warp/scalar tier discriminator — the ``S_*`` /
     ``H_*`` shape/regime features are constant within a shape, so they drop out of
     a within-shape ranking).
  3. Score candidates with a parameterized linear model and measure the golden's
     rank (top-k coverage, median rank).
  4. Random-search + coordinate-descent the weights to minimize mean ``log2(rank+1)``
     across all goldens (both tiers jointly — the ``D_*`` features are tier-aware,
     so one weight vector serves both).
  5. Print the winning weights as the ``_W_A`` dict to paste into
     ``compiler/pipeline/search/prior/analytic.py``.
