"""The per-launch watchdog must raise ``HungKernelError`` *promptly* on a real hung kernel.

This is the device-side half of the "bench must not get stuck" fix (the control-flow half —
``_run_bench`` skipping the per-kernel sweep once the device is poisoned — is covered CUDA-free
in ``tests/compiler/cli/test_tune_bench_hung_kernel.py``). Here we launch a genuinely
non-terminating kernel and assert ``_wait_for_event`` gives up at its timeout and raises,
rather than blocking forever the way a plain ``cudaDeviceSynchronize`` would.

Run in a subprocess: an infinite kernel poisons the device for the rest of the process, so we
isolate it (like ``test_bench_worker_recovery``) and let process exit tear the context down.
