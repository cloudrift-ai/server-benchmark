"""Unit tests for the liveness-based scratch-buffer memory planner.

Pure CPU — no cupy, no GPU. Validates the two helpers that decide how scratch
buffers share one slab: :func:`compute_live_intervals` (def-use over the topo
launch order, incl. TMA-source reads) and :func:`plan_offsets` (greedy packing
where only overlapping live intervals get distinct memory).
