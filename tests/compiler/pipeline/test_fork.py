"""Unit tests for ``pipeline/fork.py``'s hierarchical Fork-tree builder.

Covers the generic builder contract using synthetic knob rows so the suite
stays decoupled from any specific Tile-IR pass (`partition_loops` is the
canonical caller; its integration tests live in
``tests/compiler/passes/test_partition_planner_forks.py``). The flat
``Fork`` implementations (``OptionFork`` / ``ThunkFork``) are exercised
through the engine in ``tests/compiler/pipeline/search/test_thunk_forks.py``.
