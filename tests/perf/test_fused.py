"""Fused-kernel perf comparisons (currently SDPA).

The Emmy graph contains the high-level frontend op (``SdpaOp``);
the compiler decomposes + fuses it however it can. The ``launches``
column in the summary table records how many kernels Emmy emitted —
launches=1 means full fusion into a single kernel, launches>1 means
the chain was emitted as multiple launches. The PyTorch reference uses
``F.scaled_dot_product_attention``.
